<h1>The Panchatantra, in Sanskrit and English</h1>

This website contains the Panchatantra in Sanskrit, aligned with corresponding sections of a delightful English translation.

<p>Possible ways to use this website:
<ol>
  <li>Read the English translation, looking at the Sanskrit text whenever something seems interesting or unclear.</li>
  <li>Read both texts together simultaneously.</li>
  <li>Read the Sanskrit text, looking to the English translation whenever something seems interesting or hard to translate.</li>
</ol>
</p>

Of course you could also read just the English translation or just the Sanskrit text, ignoring the other, but that you can even do elsewhere.

<h2>Texts</h2>

The English translation used here is that by Arthur W. Ryder, published in 1925 and still in print in India.

<p>Ryder's translation can these days easily be found online:
  <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Panchatantra_(Purnabhadra%27s_Recension_of_1199_CE)">on Wikisource</a>, and scanned copies on <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00litlinks/panchatantra_ryder/index.html">Prof.&nbsp;Frances
        Pritchett's site</a>, and archive.org <a href="https://archive.org/details/Panca_tantra_Ryder1935">here</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.37110">here</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/ThePanchatantraEnglish-AwRyder">here</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/Panchatantra_Arthur_W_Ryder/">here</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/stream/TFIC_ASI_Books/Panchatantra">here</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.37110">here</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/panchatantra035159mbp">here</a></p>

<p>When I started this project ~2007 or so, only a poor scan was available (on DLI), with buggy OCR, and I had to manually read and proofread it a few times, fixing errors and manually typing missing pages (pages 77, 127, 128, 140, 141, 280, 281, 456, 457, 468, 469, 470).</p>

<p>If you want to do the first of the above, note that Ryder's translation can these days easily be found online: <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Panchatantra_(Purnabhadra%27s_Recension_of_1199_CE)">on Wikisource</a>, and scanned copies on <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00litlinks/panchatantra_ryder/index.html">Prof.&nbsp;Frances Pritchett's site</a>, and archive.org <a href="https://archive.org/details/Panca_tantra_Ryder1935">here</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.37110">here</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/ThePanchatantraEnglish-AwRyder">here</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/Panchatantra_Arthur_W_Ryder/">here</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/stream/TFIC_ASI_Books/Panchatantra">here</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.37110">here</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/panchatantra035159mbp">here</a>.

<p>If you want to do the last one above, note that the Sanskrit text is also available online: <a href="https://archive.org/details/panchatantracoll00purn">here (best scan)</a>, or <a href="http://archive.org/details/panchatantracoll00purnuoft">here</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/panchatantraaco00hertgoog">here</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/panchatantra00unkngoog">here</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/panchatantraaco01hertgoog">here</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.487255">here</a>.</li>

<h2>Why read the Panchatantra?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>It is fun. No further reason is needed besides joy! The stories and verses are a delight, both in the original and in this translation.</li>
  <li>It is one of the “bestsellers” of world literature. Probably the second-most translated book after the Christian Bible, and unlike that book, people translated it into their language just for the joy of it.</li>
  <li>Reading Vyasa/Valmiki/Kalidasa, though ..., </li>
  <li>The Sanskrit language...</li>
</ul>

<p>Ryder is scarce with the appurtenances of "scholarship", but he does give a clue to what the original used as the source text of this translation was, when he mentions:
<blockquote>Dr. Hertel, the learned and painstaking editor of the text used by the present translator, [&hellip;] The text here translated is late, dating from the year 1199 A.D.</blockquote></p>

<p>With this clue, I tracked down the source text. (Again, these days it is common knowledge, but it wasn't at the time: for me it was a fresh discovery.) The source text is also available online:</p>

      <h2>About this online edition</h2>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>This is <a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_W._Ryder">Arthur W.
      Ryder</a>’s translation of the <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchatantra">Panchatantra</a>. It
      is in my opinion the most pleasant translation into English,
      retaining the humour and wit of the original, and translating
      verse for verse and prose for prose.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Note that there are <em>many</em> version of the
      Panchatantra, with significant differences in structure and
      contents. This translation is based on a Sanskrit recension
      dated 1199 by Purnabhadra of Kashmir, as edited by Johannes
      Hertel.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

        <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

        <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

        <p>I've aligned the translation alongside the original
        text that was used as basis for the translation. The
        readability of the English version might lead one to suspect
        that Ryder, the translator, took considerable liberties with
        fidelity, but I found to my surprise that it appears to be a
        very close translation. Ryder did not intend for his
        translation to be read with the original accompanying it, but
        if you’re interested, I’ve put them side-by-side for
        comparison. Both books are public-domain (copyright expired)
        in India.</p>
