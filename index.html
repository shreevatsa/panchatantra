<p>I should update this.</p>

<p>Ryder's translation can these days easily be found online:</p>

<p>When I started this project ~2007 or so, only a poor scan was available (on DLI), with buggy OCR, and I had to manually read and proofread it a few times, fixing errors and manually typing missing pages (pages 77, 127, 128, 140, 141, 280, 281, 456, 457, 468, 469, 470).</p>

<p>Ryder is scarce with the appurtenances of "scholarship", but he does give a clue to what the original used as the source text of this translation was, when he mentions:
<blockquote>Dr. Hertel, the learned and painstaking editor of the text used by the present translator, [&hellip;] The text here translated is late, dating from the year 1199 A.D.</blockquote></p>

<p>With this clue, I tracked down the source text. (Again, these days it is common knowledge, but it wasn't at the time: for me it was a fresh discovery.) The source text is also available online:</p>

      <h2>About this online edition</h2>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>This is <a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_W._Ryder">Arthur W.
      Ryder</a>’s translation of the <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchatantra">Panchatantra</a>. It
      is in my opinion the most pleasant translation into English,
      retaining the humour and wit of the original, and translating
      verse for verse and prose for prose.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Note that there are <em>many</em> version of the
      Panchatantra, with significant differences in structure and
      contents. This translation is based on a Sanskrit recension
      dated 1199 by Purnabhadra of Kashmir, as edited by Johannes
      Hertel.</p>

        <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

        <p>I've aligned the translation alongside the original
        text that was used as basis for the translation. The
        readability of the English version might lead one to suspect
        that Ryder, the translator, took considerable liberties with
        fidelity, but I found to my surprise that it appears to be a
        very close translation. Ryder did not intend for his
        translation to be read with the original accompanying it, but
        if you’re interested, I’ve put them side-by-side for
        comparison. Both books are public-domain (copyright expired)
        in India.</p>
