      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <pre>
One Vishnusharman, shrewdly gleaning
All worldly wisdom's inner meaning,
In these five books the charm compresses
Of all such books the world possesses.
</pre>

      <p>And this is how it happened.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>In the southern country is a city called Maidens’ Delight.
      There lived a king named Immortal-Power. He was familiar with
      all the works treating of the wise conduct of life. His feet
      were made dazzling by the tangle of rays of light from jewels
      in the diadems of mighty kings who knelt before him. He had
      reached the far shore of all the arts that embellish life.
      This king had three sons. Their names were Rich-Power,
      Fierce-Power, Endless-Power, and they were supreme
      blockheads.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now when the king perceived that they were hostile to
      education, he summoned his counselors and said: “Gentlemen,
      it is known to you that these sons of mine, being hostile to
      education, are lacking in discernment. So when I behold them,
      my kingdom brings me no happiness, though all external thorns
      are drawn. For there is wisdom in the proverb:</p>
      <pre>
Of sons unborn, or dead, or fools,
    Unborn or dead will do:
They cause a little grief, no doubt;
    But fools, a long life through.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
To what good purpose can a cow
    That brings no calf nor milk, be bent?
Or why beget a son who proves
    A dunce and disobedient?
</pre>

      <p>Some means must therefore be devised to awaken their
      intelligence.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>And they, one after another, replied: “O King, first one
      learns grammar, in twelve years. If this subject has somehow
      been mastered, then one masters the books on religion and
      practical life. Then the intelligence awakens.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>But one of their number, a counselor named Keen, said: “O
      King, the duration of life is limited, and the verbal
      sciences require much time for mastery. Therefore let some
      kind of epitome be devised to wake their intelligence. There
      is a proverb that says:</p>
      <pre>
Since verbal science has no final end,
Since life is short, and obstacles impend,
Let central facts be picked and firmly fixed,
As swans extract the milk with water mixed.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

     <p>“Now there is a Brahman here named Vishnusharman,
      with a reputation for competence in numerous sciences.
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n59.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img src="hertel2/n59.jpg" style="--frac:0.125" loading="lazy"/></span>
      Intrust the princes to him. He will certainly make them
      intelligent in a twinkling.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When the king had listened to this, he summoned
      Vishnusharman and said: “Holy sir, as a favor to me you must
      make these princes incomparable masters of the art of
      practical life. In return, I will bestow upon you a hundred
      land-grants.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>And Vishnusharman made answer to the king: “O King,
      listen. Here is the plain truth. I am not the man to sell
      good learning for a hundred land-grants. But if I do not, in
      six months’ time, make the boys acquainted with the art of
      intelligent living, I will give up my own name. Let us cut
      the matter short. Listen to my lion-roar. My boasting arises
      from no greed for cash. Besides, I have no use for money; I
      am eighty years old, and all the objects of sensual desire
      have lost their charm. But in order that your request may be
      granted, I will show a sporting spirit in reference to
      artistic matters. Make a note of the date. If I fail to
      render your sons, in six months’ time, incomparable masters
      of the art of intelligent living, then His Majesty is at
      liberty to show me His Majestic bare bottom.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When the king, surrounded by his counselors, had listened
      to the Brahman’s highly unconventional promise, he was
      penetrated with wonder, intrusted the princes to him, and
      experienced supreme content. Meanwhile, Vishnusharman took
      the boys, went home, and made them learn by heart five books
      which he composed and called: (I) “The Loss of Friends,” (II)
      “The Winning of Friends,” (III) “Crows and Owls,” (IV) “Loss
      of Gains,” (V) “Ill-considered Action.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>These the princes learned, and in six months’ time they
      answered the prescription. Since that day this work on the
      art of intelligent living, called <em>Panchatantra</em>, or
      the “Five Books,” has traveled the world, aiming at the
      awakening of intelligence in the young. To sum the matter
      up:</p>
      <pre>
Whoever learns the work by heart,
Or through the story-teller's art
    Becomes acquainted,
His life by sad defeat&mdash;although
The king of heaven be his foe&mdash;
    Is never tainted.
</pre>
