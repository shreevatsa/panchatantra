    <p>Here then begins Book I, called “The Loss of  Friends.”
    The first verse runs:</p>
    <pre>
The forest lion and the bull
Were linked in friendship, growing, full:
A jackal then estranged the friends
For greedy and malicious ends.
</pre>

    <p>And this is how it happened.</p>

    <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

    <p>In the southern country was a city called Maidens’ Delight.
    It rivaled the city of heaven’s King, so abounding in every
    urban excellence as to form the central jewel of Earth’s
    diadem. Its contour was like that of Kailasa Peak. Its gates
    and palaces were stocked with machines, missile weapons, and
    chariots in great variety. Its central portal, massive as
    Indrakila Mountain, was fitted with bolt and bar, panel and
    arch, all formidable, impressive, solid. Its numerous temples
    lifted their firm bulk near spacious squares and crossings. It
    wore a moat-girdled zone of walls that recalled the
    high-uplifted Himalayas.</p>

    <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

    <p>In this city lived a merchant named Increase. He possessed a
    heap of numerous virtues, and a heap of money, a result of the
    accumulation of merit in earlier lives.</p>

    <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

    <p>As he once pondered in the dead of night, his conclusions
    took this form: “Even an abundant store of wealth, if pecked
    at, sinks together like a pile of soot. A very little, if added
    to, grows like an ant-hill. Hence, even though money be
    abundant, it should be increased. Riches unearned should be
    earned. What is earned, should be guarded. What is guarded,
    should be enlarged and heedfully invested. Money, even if
    hoarded in commonplace fashion, is likely to go in a flash, the
    hindrances being many. Money unemployed when opportunities
    arise, is the same as money unpossessed. Therefore, money once
    acquired should be guarded, increased, employed. As the proverb
    says:</p>
    <pre>
Release the money you have earned;
    So keep it safely still:
The surplus water of a tank
    Must find a way to spill.

Wild elephants are caught by tame;
With capital it is the same:
In business, beggars have no scope
Whose stock-in-trade is empty hope.

If any fail to use his fate
For joy in this or future state,
His riches serve as foolish fetters;
He simply keeps them for his betters.”
</pre>

    <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

    <p>Having thus set his mind in order, he collected merchandise
    bound for the city of Mathura, assembled his servants, and
    after saying farewell to his parents when asterism and lunar
    station were auspicious, set forth from the city, with his
    people following and with blare of conch-shell and beat of drum
    preceding. At the first water he bade his friends turn back,
    while he proceeded.</p>

    <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

    <p>To bear the yoke he had two bulls of good omen. Their names
    were Joyful and Lively; they looked like white clouds, and
    their chests were girded with golden bells.</p>

    <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n61.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img src="hertel2/n61.jpg" style="--frac:0.15" loading="lazy"/></span>
   <p>Presently he reached a forest lovely with grisleas,
    acacias, dhaks, and sals, densely planted with other trees of
    charming aspect; fearsome with elephants, wild oxen, buffaloes,
    deer, grunting-cows, boars, tigers, leopards, and bears;
    abounding in water that issued from the flanks of mountains;
    rich in caves and thickets.</p>

    <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

    <p>Here the bull Lively was overcome, partly by the excessive
    weight of the wagon, partly because one foot sank helpless
    where far-flung water from cascades made a muddy spot. At this
    spot the bull somehow snapped the yoke and sank in a heap. When
    the driver saw that he was down, he jumped excitedly from the
    wagon, ran to the merchant not far away, and humbly bowing,
    said: “Oh, my lord! Lively was wearied by the trip, and sank in
    the mud.”</p>

    <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

    <p>On hearing this, merchant Increase was deeply dejected. He
    halted for five nights, but when the poor bull did not return
    to health, he left caretakers with a supply of fodder, and
    said: “You must join me later, bringing Lively, if he lives; if
    he dies, after performing the last sad rites.” Having given
    these directions, he started for his destination.</p>

    <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

    <p>On the next day, the men, fearing the many drawbacks of the
    forest, started also and made a false report to their master.
    “Poor Lively died,” they said, “and we performed the last sad
    rites with fire and everything else.” And the merchant, feeling
    grieved for a mere moment, out of gratitude performed a
    ceremony that included rites for the departed, then journeyed
    without hindrance to Mathura.</p>

    <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

    <p>In the meantime, Lively, since his fate willed it and
    further life was predestined, hobbled step by step to the bank
    of the Jumna, his body invigorated by a mist of spray from the
    cascades. There he browsed on the emerald tips of grass-blades,
    and in a few days grew plump as Shiva’s bull, high-humped, and
    full of energy. Every day he tore the tops of anthills with
    goring horns, and frisked like an elephant.</p>

    <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

    <p>But one day a lion named Rusty, with a retinue of all kinds
    of animals, came down to the bank of the Jumna for water. There
    he heard Lively’s prodigious bellow. The sound troubled his
    heart exceedingly, but he concealed his inner feelings while
    beneath a spreading banyan tree he drew up his company in what
    is called the Circle of Four.</p>

    <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

    <p>Now the divisions of the Circle of Four are given as: (1)
    the lion, (2) the lion’s guard, (3) the understrappers, (4) the
    menials. In all cities, capitals, towns, hamlets,
    market-centers, settlements, borderposts, land-grants,
    monasteries, and communities there is just one occupant of the
    lion’s post. Relatively few are active as the lion’s guard. The
    understrappers are the indiscriminate throng. The menials are
    posted on the outskirts. The three classes are each divided
    into members high, middle, and low.</p>

    <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

    <p>Now Rusty, with counselors and intimates, enjoyed a kingship
    of the following order. His royal office, though lacking the
    pomp of umbrella, flyflap, fan, vehicle, and amorous display,
    was held erect by sheer pride in the sentiment of unaffected
    pluck. It showed unbroken haughtiness and abounding
    self-esteem. It manifested a native zeal for unchecked power
    that brooked no rival. It was ignorant of cringing speech,
    which it delegated to those who like that sort of thing. It
    functioned by means of impatience, wrath, haste, and hauteur.
    Its manly goal was fearlessness, disdaining fawning, strange to
    obsequiousness, unalarmed. It made use of no wheedling
    artifices, but glittered in its reliance on enterprise, valor,
    dignity. It was independent, unattached, free from selfish
    worry. It advertised the reward of manliness by its pleasure in
    benefiting others. It was unconquered, free from constraint and
    meanness, while it had no thought of elaborating defensive
    works. It kept no account of revenue and expenditure. It knew
    no deviousness nor time-serving, but was prickly with the
    energy earned by loftiness of spirit. It wasted no deliberation
    on the conventional six expedients, nor did it hoard weapons or
    jewelry. It had an uncommon appetite for power, never adopted
    subterfuges, was never an object of suspicion. It paid no heed
    to wives or ambush-layers, to their torrents of tears or their
    squeals. It was without reproach. It had no artificial training
    in the use of weapons, but it did not disappoint expectations.
    It found satisfactory food and shelter without dependence on
    servants. It had no timidity about any foreign forest, and no
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n62.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x066" src="hertel2/n62.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>     alarms. Its head was high. As the proverb says:</p>
    <pre>
The lion needs, in forest station,
No trappings and no education,
    But lonely power and pride;
And all the song his subjects sing,
Is in the words: “O King! O King!”
    No epithet beside.
</pre>

    <p>And again:</p>
    <pre>
The lion needs, for his appointing,
No ceremony, no anointing;
His deeds of heroism bring
Him fortune. Nature crowns him king.

The elephant is the lion's meat,
With drops of trickling ichor sweet;
Though lack thereof should come to pass,
The lion does not nibble grass.
</pre>

    <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

    <p>Now Rusty had in his train two jackals, sons of counselors,
    but out of a job. Their names were Cheek and Victor. These two
    conferred secretly, and Victor said: “My dear Cheek, just look
    at our master Rusty. He came this way for water. For what
    reason does he crouch here so disconsolate?” “Why meddle, my
    dear fellow?” said Cheek. “There is a saying:</p>
    <pre>
Death pursues the meddling flunkey:
Note the wedge-extracting monkey.”
</pre>

    <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

    <p>“How was that?” asked Victor. And Cheek told the story
    of</p>
    </div>

    <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

    <div id="the-wedge-pulling-monkey">
      <h2><a href="#TOC">The Wedge-Pulling Monkey</a></h2>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>There was a city in a certain region. In a grove near by,
      a merchant was having a temple built. Each day at the noon
      hour the foreman and workers would go to the city for
      lunch.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now one day a troop of monkeys came upon the half-built
      temple. There lay a tremendous anjana-log, which a mechanic
      had begun to split, a wedge of acacia-wood being thrust in at
      the top.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>There the monkeys began their playful frolics upon
      tree-top, lofty roof, and woodpile. Then one of them, whose
      doom was near, thoughtlessly bestrode the log, thinking: “Who
      stuck a wedge in this queer place?” So he seized it with both
      hands and started to work it loose. Now what happened when
      the wedge gave at the spot where his private parts entered
      the cleft, that, sir, you know without being told.</p>
    </div>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p><!-- Break -->

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <div class="outer-frame-story">
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n63.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x067" src="hertel2/n63.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>“And that is why I say that meddling should be 
      avoided by the intelligent. And you know,” he continued,
      “that we two pick up a fair living just from his
      leavings.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“But,” said Victor, “how can you give first-rate service
      merely from a desire for food with no desire for distinction?
      There is wisdom in the saying:</p>
      <pre>
In hurting foes and helping friends
The wise perceive the proper ends
Of serving kings. The belly's call
To answer, is no job at all.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
When many lives on one depend,
    Then life is life indeed:
A crow, with beak equipped, can fill
    His belly's selfish need.

If loving kindness be not shown
    To friends and souls in pain,
To teachers, servants, and one's self,
    What use in life, what gain?
A crow will live for many years
    And eat the offered grain.

A dog is quite contented if
    He gets a meatless bone,
A dirty thing with gristle-strings
    And marrow-fat alone&mdash;
And not enough of it at that
    To still his belly's moan.

The lion scorns the jackal, though
    Between his paws, to smite
The elephant. For everyone,
    However sad his plight,
Demands the recompense that he
    Esteems his native right.

Dogs wag their tails and fawn and roll,
    Bare mouth and belly, at your feet:
Bull-elephants show self-esteem,
    Demand much coaxing ere they eat.

A tiny rill
Is quick to fill,
    And quick a mouse's paws;
So seedy men
Are grateful, when
    There is but little cause.

For if there be no mind
    Debating good and ill,
And if religion send
    No challenge to the will,
If only greed be there
    For some material feast,
How draw a line between
    The man-beast and the beast?
</pre>

      <p>Or more accurately yet:</p>
      <pre>
Since cattle draw the plow
    Through rough and level soil,
And bend their patient necks
    To heavy wagons' toil,
Are kind, of sinless birth,
    And find in grass a feast,
How can they be compared
    With any human beast?”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“But at present,” said Cheek, “we two hold no job at
      court. So why meddle?” “My dear fellow,” said Victor, “after
      a little the jobless man does hold a job. As the saying
      goes:</p>
      <pre>
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n64.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x068" src="hertel2/n64.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>The jobless man is hired                                
    For careful serving;
The holder may be fired,
    If undeserving.

No character moves up or down
At others' smile or others' frown;
But honor or contempt on earth
Will follow conduct's inner worth.
</pre>

      <p>And once more:</p>
      <pre>
It costs an effort still
To carry stones uphill;
They tumble in a trice:
So virtue, and so vice.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Well,” said Cheek, “what do you wish to imply?” And
      Victor answered: “You see, our master is frightened, his
      servants are frightened, and he does not know what to do.”
      “How can you be sure of that?” asked Cheek, and Victor said:
      “Isn’t it plain?</p>
      <pre>
An ox can understand, of course,
The spoken word; a driven horse
Or elephant, exerts his force;

But men of wisdom can infer
Unuttered thought from features' stir&mdash;
For wit rewards its worshiper.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
From feature, gesture, gait,
    From twitch, or word,
From change in eye or face
    Is thought inferred.
</pre>

      <p>So by virtue of native intelligence I intend to get him
      into my power this very day.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Why,” said Cheek, “you do not know how to make yourself
      useful to a superior. So tell me. How can you establish power
      over him?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“And why, my good fellow, do I not know how to make myself
      useful?” said Victor. “The saintly poet Vyasa has sung the
      entry of the Pandu princes into Virata’s court. From his poem
      I learned the whole duty of a functionary. You have heard the
      proverb:</p>
      <pre>
No burden enervates the strong;
To enterprise no road is long;
The well-informed all countries range;
To flatterers no man is strange.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>But Cheek objected: “He might perhaps despise you for
      forcing yourself into a position that does not belong to
      you.” “Yes,” said Victor, “there is point in that. However, I
      am also a judge of occasions. And there are rules, as
      follows:</p>
      <pre>
The Lord of Learning, speaking to
    A false occasion,
Will meet with hatred, and of course
    Lack all persuasion.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
The favorite's business comes to be
A sudden source of king's <i>ennui</i>,
When he is thoughtful, trying scents,
Retiring, or in conference.
</pre>

      <p>And once again:</p>
      <pre>
On hours of talk or squabbling rude,
Of physic, barber, flirting, food,
A gentleman does not intrude.

Let everyone be cautious
    In palaces of kings;
And let not students rummage
    In their professor's things:
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n65.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x069" src="hertel2/n65.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>For naughty meddlers suffer                             
    Destruction swift and sure,
Like evening candles, lighted
    In houses of the poor.
</pre>

      <p>Or put it this way:</p>
      <pre>
On entering a palace,
    Adjust a modest dress;
Go slowly, bowing lowly
    In timely humbleness;
And sound the kingly temper,
    And kingly whims no less.
</pre>

      <p>Or this way:</p>
      <pre>
Though ignorant and common,
    Unworth the honoring,
Men win to royal favor
    By standing near the king:
For kings and vines and maidens
    To nearest neighbors cling.
</pre>

      <p>And once again:</p>
      <pre>
The servant in his master's face
Discerns the signs of wrath and grace,
And though the master jerk and tack,
The servant slowly mounts his back.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>And finally:</p>
      <pre>
The brave, the learnèd, he who wins
    To bureaucratic power
These three, alone of all mankind,
    Can pluck earth's golden flower.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Now let me inform you how power is gained by dancing
      attendance on a master.</p>
      <pre>
Win the friendly counselors,
    To the monarch dear,
Win persuasive speakers; so
    Gain the royal ear.

On the undiscerning mob
    'Tis not wise to toil:
No man reaps a harvest by
    Plowing barren soil.

Serve a king of merit, though
    Friendless, destitute;
After some delay, you pluck
    Long-enduring fruit.

Hate your master, and you fill
    Servant's meanest state:
Not discerning whom to serve,
    'Tis yourself you hate.

Treat the dowager, the queen,
    And the king-to-be,
Chaplain, porter, counselor,
    Most obsequiously.

One who seeks the van in fights,
    In the palace clings,
In the city walks behind,
    Is beloved of kings.

One who flatters when addressed,
    Does the proper things.
Acts without expressing doubts.
    Is beloved of kings.

One, the royal gifts of cash
    Prudently who flings,
Wearing gifts of garments, he
    Is beloved of kings.

One who never makes reply
    That his master stings,
Never boisterously laughs,
    Is beloved of kings.

One who never hearkens to
    Queenly whisperings,
In the women's quarters dumb,
    Is beloved of kings.

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n66.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x070" src="hertel2/n66.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>One who, even in distress,                              
    Never boasts and sings
Of his master's favor, he
    Is beloved of kings.

One who hates his master's foe,
    Loves his friend, and brings
Pain or joy to either one,
    Is beloved of kings.

One who never disagrees,
    Blames, or pulls the strings
Of intrigue with enemies,
    Is beloved of kings.

One who finds in battle, peace
    Free from questionings,
Thinks of exile as of home,
    Is beloved of kings.

One who thinks of dice as death,
    Wine as poison-stings,
Others' wives as statues, he
    Is beloved of kings.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Well,” said Cheek, “when you come into his presence, what
      do you intend to say first? Please tell me that.” And Victor
      replied:</p>
      <pre>
“Answers, after speech begins,
    Further answers breed,
As a seed, with timely rain,
    Ripens other seed.
</pre>

      <p>And besides:</p>
      <pre>
A clever servant shows his master
The gleam of triumph or disaster
From good or evil courses springing,
And shows him wit, decision-bringing.

The man possessing such a wit
Should magnify and foster it;
Thereby he earns a livelihood
And public honor from the good.
</pre>

      <p>And there is a saying:</p>
      <pre>
Let anyone who does not seek
His master's fall, unbidden speak;
So act at least the excellent:
The other kind are different.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“But,” said Cheek, “kings are hard to conciliate. There is
      a saying:</p>
      <pre>
In sensuous coil
And heartless toil,
In sinuous course
And armored force,
In savage harms
That yield to charms&mdash;
In all these things
Are snakes like kings.

Uneven, rough,
And high enough&mdash;
Yet low folk roam
Their flanks as home,
And wild things haunt
Them, hungry, gaunt&mdash;
In all these things
Are hills like kings.

The things that claw, and the things that gore
    Are unreliable things;
And so is a man with a sword in his hand,
    And rivers, and women, and kings.”
</pre>

      <p>“Quite true,” said Victor. “However:</p>
      <pre>
The clever man soon penetrates
The subject's mind, and captivates.

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n67.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x071" src="hertel2/n67.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>Cringe, and flatter him when angry;                     
    Love his friend and hate his foe;
Duly advertise his presents&mdash;
    Trust no magic&mdash;win him so.
</pre>

      <p>And yet:</p>
      <pre>
If a man excel in action,
    Learning, fluent word,
Make yourself his humble servant
    While his power is stirred,
Quick to leave him at the moment
    When he grows absurd.

Plant your words where profit lies:
Whiter cloth takes faster dyes.

Till you know his power and manhood,
    Effort has no scope:
Moonlight's glitter vainly rivals
    Himalaya's slope.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>And Cheek replied: “If you have made up your mind, then
      seek the feet of the king. Blest be your journeyings. May
      your purpose be accomplished.</p>
      <pre>
Be heedful in the presence of the king;
We also to your health and fortune cling.”
</pre>

      <p>Then Victor bowed to his friend, and went to meet
      Rusty.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now when Rusty saw Victor approaching, he said to the
      doorkeeper: “Away with your reed of office! This is an old
      acquaintance, the counselor’s son Victor. He has free
      entrance. Let him come in. He belongs to the second circle.”
      So Victor entered, bowed to Rusty, and sat down on the seat
      indicated to him.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then Rusty extended a right paw adorned with claws as
      formidable as thunderbolts, and said respectfully: “Do you
      enjoy health? Why has so long a time passed since you were
      last visible?” And Victor replied: “Even though my royal
      master has no present need of me, still I ought to report at
      the proper time. For there is nothing that may not render
      service to a king. As the saying goes:</p>
      <pre>
To clean a tooth or scratch an ear
    A straw may serve a king:
A man, with speech and action, is
    A higher kind of thing.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Besides, we who are ancestral servants of our royal
      master, follow him even in disasters. For us there is no
      other course. Now the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
Set in fit position each
    Gem or serving-man;
No tiaras on the toes,
    Just because you can.

Servants leave the kings who their
    Qualities ignore,
Even kings of lofty line,
    Wealthy, served of yore.
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n68.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x072" src="hertel2/n68.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>Lacking honor from their equals,                        
    Jobless, <i>déclassé</i>,
Servants give their master notice
    That they will not stay.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
If set in tin, a gem that would
    Adorn a golden frame,
Will never scream nor fail to gleam,
    Yet tells its wearer's shame.

The king who reads a servant's mind&mdash;
    Dull, faithless, faithful, wise&mdash;
May servants find of every kind
    For every enterprise.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“And as for my master’s remark: ‘It is long since you were
      last visible,’ pray hear the reason of that:</p>
      <pre>
Where just distinction is not drawn
    Between the left and right,
The self-respecting, if they can,
    Will quickly take to flight.

If masters no distinction make
    Among their servants, then
They lose the zealous offices
    Of energetic men.

And in a market where it seems
    That no distinctions hold
Between red-eye and ruby, how
    Can precious gems be sold?

There must be bonds of union
    In all their dealings, since
No prince can lack his servants
    Nor servants lack a prince.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Yet the nature of the servant also depends on the
      master’s quality. As the saying goes:</p>
      <pre>
In case of horse or book or sword,
Of woman, man or lute or word,
The use or uselessness depends
On qualities the user lends.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“And another point. You do wrong to despise me because I
      am a jackal. For</p>
      <pre>
Silk comes from worms, and gold from stone;
From cow's hair sacred grass is grown;
The water-lily springs from mud;
From cow-dung sprouts the lotus-bud;
The moon its rise from ocean takes;
And gems proceed from hoods of snakes;
From cows' bile yellow dyestuffs come;
And fire in wood is quite at home:
The worthy, by display of worth,
Attain distinction, not by birth.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
Kill, although domestic born,
    Any hurtful mouse:
Bribe an alien cat who will
    Help to clean the house.
</pre>

      <p>And once again:</p>
      <pre>
How use the faithful, lacking power?
    Or strong, who evil do?
But me, O King, you should not scorn,
    For I am strong and true.

Scorn not the wise who penetrate
    Truth's universal law;
They are not men to be restrained
    By money's petty straw:
When beauty glistens on their cheeks
    By trickling ichor lent,
Bull-elephants feel lotus-chains
    As no impediment.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n69.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x073" src="hertel2/n69.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>“Oh,” said Rusty, “you must not say such things.  You
      are our counselor’s son, an old retainer.” “O King,” said
      Victor, “there is something that should be said.” And the
      king replied: “My good fellow, reveal what is in your
      heart.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then Victor began: “My master set out to take water. Why
      did he turn back and camp here?” And Rusty, concealing his
      inner feelings, said: “Victor, it just happened so.” “O
      King,” said the jackal, “if it is not a thing to disclose,
      then let it be.</p>
      <pre>
Some things a man should tell his wife,
    Some things to friend and some to son;
All these are trusted. He should not
    Tell everything to everyone.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Hereupon Rusty reflected: “He seems trustworthy. I will
      tell him what I have in mind. For the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
You find repose, in sore disaster,
By telling things to powerful master,
To honest servant, faithful friend,
Or wife who loves you till the end.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Friend Victor, did you hear a great voice in the
      distance?” “Yes, master, I did,” said Victor. “What of
      it?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>And Rusty continued: “My good fellow, I intend to leave
      this forest.” “Why?” said Victor. “Because,” said Rusty,
      “there has come into our forest some prodigious creature,
      from whom we hear this great voice. His nature must
      correspond to his voice, and his power to his nature.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“What!” said Victor. “Is our master frightened by a mere
      voice? You know the proverb:</p>
      <pre>
Water undermines the dikes;
Love dissolves when malice strikes;
Secrets melt when babblings start;
Simple words melt dastard hearts.
</pre>

      <p>So it would be improper if our master abruptly left the
      forest which was won by his ancestors and has been so long in
      the family. For they say:</p>
      <pre>
Wisely move one foot; the other
    Should its vantage hold;
Till assured of some new dwelling,
    Do not leave the old.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Besides, many kinds of sounds are heard here. Yet they
      are nothing but noises, not a warning of danger. For example,
      we hear the sounds made by thunder, wind among the reeds,
      lutes, drums, tambourines, conch-shells, bells, wagons,
      banging doors, machines, and other things. They are nothing
      to be afraid of. As the verse says:</p>
      <pre>
If a king be brave, however
    Fierce the foe and grim,
Sorrows of humiliation
    Do not wait for him.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
Bravest bosoms do not falter,
    Fearing heaven's threat:
Summer dries the pools; the Indus
    Rises, greater yet.
</pre>

      <p>And once again:</p>
      <pre>
Mothers bear on rare occasions
    To the world a chief,
Glad in luck and brave in battle,
    Undepressed in grief.
</pre>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n70.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x074" src="hertel2/n70.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>And yet again: </p>
      <pre>
Do not act as does the grass-blade.
    Lacking honest pride,
Drooping low in feeble meanness,
    Lightly brushed aside.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>My master must take this point of view and reinforce his
      resolution, not fear a mere sound. As the saying goes:</p>
      <pre>
I thought at first that it was full
    Of fat; I crept within
And there I did not find a thing
    Except some wood and skin.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“How was that?” asked Rusty. And Victor told the story
      of</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>
    </div><!-- closing the outer-frame-story -->

    <div id="the-jackal-and-the-war-drum">
      <h2><a href="#TOC">The Jackal and the War-Drum</a></h2>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>In a certain region was a jackal whose throat was pinched
      by hunger. While wandering in search of food, he came upon a
      king’s battle ground in the midst of a forest. And as he
      lingered a moment there, he heard a great sound.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>This sound troubled his heart exceedingly, so that he fell
      into deep dejection and said: “Ah me! Disaster is upon me. I
      am as good as dead already. Who made that sound? What kind of
      a creature?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>But on peering about, he spied a war-drum that loomed like
      a mountain-peak, and he thought: “Was that sound its natural
      voice, or was it induced from without?” Now when the drum was
      struck by the tips of grasses swaying in the wind, it made
      the sound, but was dumb at other times.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So he recognized its helplessness, and crept quite near.
      Indeed, his curiosity led him to strike it himself on both
      heads, and he became gleeful at the thought: “Aha! After long
      waiting food comes even to me. For this is sure to be stuffed
      with meat and fat.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Having come to this conclusion, he picked a spot, gnawed a
      hole, and crept in. And though the leather covering was
      tough, still he had the luck not to break his teeth. But he
      was disappointed to find it pure wood and skin, and recited a
      stanza:</p>
      <pre>
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n71.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x075" src="hertel2/n71.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>Its voice was fierce; I thought it stuffed              
    With fat, so crept within;
And there I did not find a thing
    Except some wood and skin.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So he backed out, laughing to himself, and said:</p>
      <pre>
I thought at first that it was full
Of fat, ....
</pre>

      <p>and the rest of it.</p>
    </div><div class="outer-frame-story">

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“And that is why I say that one should not be troubled by
      a mere sound.” “But,” said Rusty, “these retainers of mine
      are terrified and wish to run away. So how am I to reinforce
      my resolution?” And Victor answered: “Master, they are not to
      blame. For servants take after the master. You know the
      proverb:</p>
      <pre>
In case of horse or book or sword,
Of woman, man or lute or word,
The use or uselessness depends
On qualities the user lends.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Then summon your manhood and remain on this spot until I
      return, having ascertained the nature of the creature. Then
      act as seems proper.” “What!” said Rusty, “are you plucky
      enough to go there?” And Victor answered: “When the master
      commands, is there any difference between ‘possible’ and
      ‘impossible’ to the good servant? As the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
Good servants, when their lords command,
Behold no fear on any hand,
Cross pathless seas if he desire
Or gladly enter flaming fire.

The servant who, his lord commanding,
Should strive to reach an understanding
On labors hard or easy, he
King's counselor should never be.”
</pre>

      <p>“If you feel so, my dear fellow,” said Rusty, “then go.
      Blest be your journeyings.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So Victor bowed low and set out in the direction of the
      sound made by Lively. And when he was gone, terror troubled
      Rusty’s heart, so that he thought: “Ah, I made a sad mistake
      in trusting him to the point of revealing what is in my mind.
      Perhaps this Victor will betray me by taking wages from both
      parties, or from spite at losing his job. For the proverb
      says:</p>
      <pre>
A servant suffering from a king
Dishonor after honoring,
Though born and trained to service, will
Be eager to destroy him still.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“So I will go elsewhere and wait, in order to learn his
      purpose. Perhaps Victor might even bring the thing along and
      try to kill me. As the saying goes:</p>
      <pre>
The trustful strong are caught
    By weaker foes with ease;
The wary weak are safe
    From strongest enemies.”
</pre>

      <p>Thus he set his mind in order, went elsewhere, and waited
      all alone, spying on Victor’s procedure.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Meanwhile Victor drew near to Lively, discovered that he
      was a bull, and reflected gleefully: “Well, well! This is
      lucky. I shall get Rusty into my power by dangling before him
      war or peace with this fellow. As the proverb puts it:</p>
      <pre>
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n72.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x076" src="hertel2/n72.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>All counselors draw profit from                         
    A king in worries pent,
And that is why they always wish
    For him, embarrassment.

As men in health require no drug
    Their vigor to restore,
So kings, relieved of worry, seek
    Their counselors no more.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>With these thoughts in mind, he returned to meet Rusty.
      And Rusty, seeing him coming, assumed his former attitude in
      an effort to put a good face on the matter. So when Victor
      had come near, had bowed low, and had seated himself, Rusty
      said: “My good fellow, did you see the creature?” “I saw
      him,” said Victor, “through my master’s grace.” “Are you
      telling the truth?” asked Rusty. And Victor answered: “How
      could I report anything else to my gracious master? For the
      proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
Whoever makes before a king
    Small statements, but untrue,
Brings certain ruin on his gods
    And on his teacher, too.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
The king incarnates all the gods,
    So sing the sages old;
Then treat him like the gods: to him
    Let nothing false be told.
</pre>

      <p>And once again:</p>
      <pre>
The king incarnates all the gods,
    Yet with a difference:
He pays for good or ill at once;
    The gods, a lifetime hence.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Yes,” said Rusty, “I suppose you really did see him. The
      great do not become angry with the mean. As the proverb
      says:</p>
      <pre>
The hurricane innocuous passes
O'er feeble, lowly bending grasses,
But tears at lofty trees: the great
Their prowess greatly demonstrate.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>And Victor replied: “I knew beforehand that my master
      would speak thus. So why waste words? I will bring the
      creature into my gracious master’s presence.” And when Rusty
      heard this, joy overspread his lotus-face, and his mind felt
      supreme satisfaction.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Meanwhile Victor returned and called reproachfully to
      Lively: “Come here, you villainous bull! Come here! Our
      master Rusty asks why you are not afraid to keep up this
      meaningless bellowing.” And Lively answered: “My good fellow,
      who is this person named Rusty?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“What!” said Victor, “you do not even know our master
      Rusty?” And he continued with indignation: “The consequences
      will teach you. He has a retinue of all kinds of animals. He
      dwells beside the spreading banyan tree. His heart is high
      with pride. He is lord of life and wealth. His name is Rusty.
      He is a mighty lion.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When Lively heard this, he thought himself as good as
      dead, and he fell into deep dejection, saying: “My dear
      fellow, you appear to be sympathetic and eloquent. So if you
      cannot avoid conducting me there, pray cause the master to
      grant me a gracious safe-conduct.” “You are quite right,”
      said Victor. “Your request shows <em>savoir faire</em>.
      For</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n73.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x077" src="hertel2/n73.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>The earth has a limit,                                  
    The mountains, the sea;
The deep thoughts of kings are
    Without boundary.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Do you then remain in this spot. Later, when I have held
      him to an agreement, I will conduct you to him.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then Victor returned to Rusty and said: “Master, he is no
      ordinary creature. He has served as the vehicle of blessed
      Shiva. And when I questioned him, he said: ‘Great Shiva was
      satisfied with me and bade me crop the grass beside the
      Jumna. Why make a long story of it? The blessed one has given
      me this forest as a playground.’”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>At this Rusty was frightened, and he said: “I knew it, I
      knew it. Only by special favor of the gods do creatures
      wander in a wild wood, bellowing like that, and fearlessly
      cropping the grass. But what did you say?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Master,” said Victor, “I said: ‘This forest is the domain
      of Rusty, vehicle of Shiva’s passionate wife. Hence you come
      as a guest. You must meet him, must spend your time in
      brotherly love, must eat, drink, work, play, and make your
      home with him.’ All this he promised, adding: ‘You must make
      your master grant me a safe-conduct.’ As to that, the master
      is the sole judge.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>At this Rusty was delighted and said: “Splendid, my
      intelligent servant, splendid! You must have taken counsel
      with my own heart before speaking. I grant him a
      safe-conduct. You must hasten to conduct him here, but not
      until he too has bound himself by oath toward me. Yes, there
      is sound sense in the saying:</p>
      <pre>
Polished, fully tested,
    Sturdy too, and straight
Are the pillars proper
    To a house&mdash;or state.
</pre>

      <p>Again:</p>
      <pre>
Wit is shown in hours of crisis:
    Doctors' wit, in sore disease;
Counselors', in patching friendship&mdash;
    All are wise in hours of ease.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now Victor thought, as he set out to meet Lively: “Well,
      well! The master is gracious to me and ready to do my
      bidding. So there is none more blest than I. For</p>
      <pre>
Four things are nectar: milky food;
    A fire in chilly weather;
An honor granted by the king;
    And loved ones, come together.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So he found Lively, and said respectfully: “My friend, I
      won the old master’s favor for you, and made him give you a
      safe-conduct. You may go without anxiety. Still, though you
      have favor in the eyes of the king, you must act in agreement
      with me. You must not play the haughty master. I for my part,
      in alliance with you, will take the rôle of counselor, and
      bear the whole burden of administration. Thus we shall both
      enjoy royal affluence. For</p>
      <pre>
A sinful chase&mdash;yet men can stalk
    The treasures of the crown:
One starts the quarry from its lair;
    Another strikes it down.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
Whoever is too haughty to
Pay king's retainers honor due,
Will find his feet are tottering&mdash;
So merchant Strong-Tooth with the king.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“How was that?” asked Lively. And Victor told the story
      of</p>

      <h2><a href="#TOC">Merchant Strong-Tooth</a></h2>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n74.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x078" src="hertel2/n74.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>There is a city called Growing City on the earth’s 
      surface. In it lived a merchant named Strong-Tooth who
      directed the whole administration. So long as he handled city
      business and royal business, all the inhabitants were
      satisfied. Why spin it out? Nobody ever saw or heard of his
      like for cleverness. For there is much wisdom in the
      proverb:</p>
      <pre>
Suppose he minds the king's affairs,
    The common people hate him;
And if he plays the democrat,
    The prince will execrate him:
So, since the struggling interests
    Are wholly contradictory,
A manager is hard to find
    Who gives them both the victory.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>While he occupied this position, he once had a daughter
      married. To the wedding he invited all the townspeople and
      the king’s entourage, paid them much honor, feasted them, and
      regaled them with gifts of garments and the like. And when
      the wedding was over, he conducted the king home with his
      ladies and showed him reverence.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now the king had a house-cleaning drudge named Bull, who
      took a seat that did not belong to him—this in the very
      palace, and in the presence of the king’s professor. So
      Strong-Tooth administered a cuffing and drove him out. From
      that moment the humiliation so rankled in Bull’s inner soul
      that he had no rest even at night. Yet he thought: “After
      all, why should I grow thin? It does me no good. For I cannot
      possibly hurt him. And there is sense in the saying:</p>
      <pre>
Indulge no angry, shameless wish
    To hurt, unless you can:
The chick-pea, hopping up and down,
    Will crack no frying-pan.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n75.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x079" src="hertel2/n75.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>Now one morning, as he was sweeping near the  bed
      where the king lay half awake, he said: “What impudence!
      Strong-Tooth kisses the queen.” When the king heard this, he
      jumped up in a hurry, crying: “Come, come, Bull! Is that
      thing true that you were muttering? Has the queen been kissed
      by Strong-Tooth?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“O King,” answered Bull, “I was awake all night because I
      am passionately fond of gambling. So sleep overpowered me
      even when I was busy with my sweeping. I do not know what I
      said.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>But the jealous king thought: “Yes, he has free entrance
      to my palace. So has Strong-Tooth. Perhaps he actually saw
      the fellow hugging the queen. For the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
Whate'er a man desires, sees, does
    In broad daylight,
Still mindful, he will say or do
    Asleep at night.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
Whatever secrets, good or ill,
Men in their bosoms keep,
Are soon betrayed when they are drunk
Or talking in their sleep.
</pre>

      <p>In any case, what doubt can there be where a woman is
      concerned?</p>
      <pre>
With one she tries the gossip's art;
    Her glances with a second flirt;
She holds another in her heart:
    Whom does she love enough to hurt?
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
The logs will glut the hungry fire,
The rivers glut the sea's desire,
And Death with life be glutted, when
The flirt has had enough of men.

No chance, no corner dark,
    No man to woo;
Then, holy sage, you find
    A woman true.
</pre>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n76.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x080" src="hertel2/n76.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>And once again: </p>
      <pre>
The blunderhead who thinks:
    ‘My love loves me,’
Is ever in her power;
    A tame bird, he.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>After all this lamentation, he withdrew his favor
      forthwith from Strong-Tooth. Not to make a long story of it,
      he forbade his entrance at court. When Strong-Tooth saw that
      the monarch’s favor was suddenly withdrawn, he thought: “Ah
      me! There is wisdom in the stanza:</p>
      <pre>
Whom does not fortune render proud?
    Whom does not death lay low?
To what <i>roué</i> do passions not
    Bring never ceasing woe?

What beggar can be dignified?
    Whose heart no woman stings?
Who, trapped by scamps, comes safely off?
    Who is beloved of kings?
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
Who ever saw or heard
A gambler's truthful word,
A neat and cleanly crow,
A woman going slow
In love, a kindly snake,
A eunuch's pluck awake,
A drunkard's love of science,
A king in friends' alliance?
</pre>

      <p>And yet I never committed an unfriendly act against the
      king—or anyone else—not even in a dream, not even by mere
      words. So why does the king withdraw his favor from me?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now one day Bull, the sweeper, saw Strong-Tooth stopped at
      the palace gate, and he laughed aloud, saying to the
      doorkeepers: “Be careful, doorkeepers! This fellow
      Strong-Tooth’s temper has been spoiled by the king’s favor
      and he dispenses arrests and releases. If you stop him, you
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n77.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x081" src="hertel2/n77.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      will get a cuffing, just like me.” </p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>And Strong-Tooth reflected on hearing this: “I see. It was
      Bull’s doing. Well, there is sense in the proverb:</p>
      <pre>
Though foolish, base, and lacking pride,
A servant at the monarch's side
Will have his honor satisfied.

Though fashioned on a cowardly plan
And mean, a royal servant can
Resent affronts from any man.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>After this lamentation he went home, abashed and deeply
      stirred. Then he summoned Bull in the evening, gave him two
      garments as an honorable present, and said: “My good fellow,
      I did not drive you out by order of the king. It was because
      I saw you, in the chaplain’s presence, sitting where you did
      not belong, that I humiliated you.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now Bull received the two garments as if they were the
      Kingdom of Heaven, and feeling intense satisfaction, he said:
      “Friend merchant, I forgive you. You will soon see the reward
      of the honor shown me in the king’s favor and such things.”
      With this he departed in high glee. For there is wisdom in
      the saying:</p>
      <pre>
A little thing will lift him high,
    A little make him fall:
'Twixt balance-beam and scamp there is
    No difference at all.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>On the next day Bull entered the palace, and did his
      sweeping. And while the king lay half awake, he said: “What
      intelligence! When our king sits at stool, he eats a
      cucumber.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now the king, hearing this, rose in amazement and said:
      “Come, come, Bull! What twaddle is this? But I remember that
      you are a house-servant and do not kill you. Did you ever see
      me engaged in that occupation?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“O King,” said Bull, “I was awake all night because I am
      passionately fond of gambling. So drowsiness overcame me in
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n78.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x082" src="hertel2/n78.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      the very act of doing my sweeping.  I do not know what I
      was muttering. Pardon me, master. I was really asleep.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then the king thought: “Why, from the day of my birth I
      never ate a cucumber while engaged in that occupation. And
      since this blockhead has talked unimaginable nonsense about
      me, it must be the same with Strong-Tooth. This being so, I
      made a mistake in taking the poor man’s honors from him.
      Nothing of the sort is conceivable with such men. And in his
      absence all the king’s business and city business is at loose
      ends.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>After thus considering the matter from every point of
      view, he summoned Strong-Tooth, presented him with gems from
      his own person and with garments, and reinstated him.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>
      </div><div class="outer-frame-story">

      <p>“And that is why I say:</p>
      <pre>
Whoever is too haughty to
Pay king's retainers honor due, ....
</pre>

      <p>and the rest of it.” “My dear fellow,” said Lively, “your
      argument is quite convincing. Let it be as you say.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>After this Victor took him to Rusty and said: “O King,
      here is Lively. I have brought him hither. The future rests
      with the king.” Then Lively bowed respectfully and stood
      before the king in a modest attitude. Thereupon Rusty
      extended over him a right paw plump, firm, massive, adorned
      with claws as formidable as thunderbolts, and said with
      deference: “Do you enjoy health? Why do you dwell in this
      wild wood?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Thus questioned, Lively related accurately his separation
      from merchant Increase and the others. And Rusty, after
      listening to the story, said: “Have no fear, comrade.
      Protected by my paws, lead your own life in this forest.
      Furthermore, you must always take your amusements in my
      vicinity. For this forest has many drawbacks, since it swarms
      with numerous savage creatures.” And Lively made answer:
      “Very well, O King.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then the king of beasts went down to the bank of the
      Jumna, drank and bathed his fill, and plunged again into the
      forest, wherever inclination led him.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Thus the time passed, the mutual affection of the two
      increasing daily. Now Lively had assimilated solid
      intelligence by mastering numerous authoritative works, so
      that in a very few days he planted discernment in Rusty, dull
      as was his mind. He weaned him from forest habits and taught
      him village manners. Why spin it out? Lively and Rusty did
      nothing but hold secret confabulations every day.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>This being so, all the other animals of the retinue were
      kept at a distance. As for the two jackals, they did not even
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n79.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x083" src="hertel2/n79.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      have the entrée. More than that, as  soon as they lacked
      the lion’s prowess, the whole company of animals, not
      excluding the two jackals, suffered grievously from hunger
      and huddled together. As the proverb puts it:</p>
      <pre>
A king, though proud and pure of birth,
    Will see his servants flee
A court where no rewards are won,
    As birds a withered tree.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
They may be honored gentlemen,
    They may devoted be,
Yet servants leave a monarch who
    Forgets the salary.
</pre>

      <p>While, on the other hand:</p>
      <pre>
A king may scold
Yet servants hold,
If he but pay
Upon the day.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Indeed, all the creatures in this world, adopting cajolery
      or one of the other three devices, live by eating one
      another. For example:</p>
      <pre>
Some eat the countries; these are kings;
The doctors, those whom sickness stings;
The merchants, those who buy their things;
And learned men, the fools.

The married are the clergy's meat;
The thieves devour the indiscreet;
The flirts their eager lovers eat;
And Labor eats us all.

They keep deceitful snares in play;
They lie in wait by night and day;
And when occasion offers, prey
Like fish on lesser fish.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now Cheek and Victor, robbed of their master’s favor, took
      counsel together—for their throats were pinched with hunger.
      And Victor said: “Cheek, my noble friend, we two seem to have
      lost our job. For Rusty takes such delight in Lively’s
      conversation that he neglects his business. And the whole
      court is scattered every which way. What is to be done?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>And Cheek replied: “Even if the master does not take your
      advice, still you should admonish him to correct his faults.
      For the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
Good counselors should warn a king
    Although he pay no heed
(As Vidur warned the monarch blind)
    To cease from evil deed.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
Good counselors or drivers may not duck
From kings or elephants that run amuck.
</pre>

      <p>Besides, in introducing this grass-nibbler to the master
      you were handling live coals.” And Victor answered: “You are
      right. The fault is mine, not the master’s. As the saying
      goes:</p>
      <pre>
The jackal at the ram-fight;
    And we, when tricked by June;
The meddling friend&mdash;were playing
    A self-defeating tune.”

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“How was that?” asked Cheek. And Victor told three stories

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n80.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x084" src="hertel2/n80.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>In a certain district there was a monastery in a 
      secluded spot. In it lived a holy man named Godly, who in
      course of time acquired a great sum of money by selling
      finely woven garments, the numerous offerings of the faithful
      for whom he performed sacrifices.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>As a result, he trusted no man, and kept his treasure
      under his arm by night and day. For there is wisdom in the
      proverb:</p>
      <pre>
Money causes pain in getting;
In the keeping, pain and fretting;
Pain in loss and pain in spending:
Damn the trouble never ending!
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now a rogue named June, who took other people’s money from
      them, observed the treasure under his arm, and reflected:
      “How am I to take this treasure from him? In the first place,
      I cannot pierce the wall of the cell, which is compactly
      built of solid stone. And I cannot enter the door, which is
      too high. I will talk to him, win his confidence, and become
      his disciple, for he will be in my power when I have his
      confidence. As the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
None lacking shrewdness flatter well;
None but a lover plays the swell;
No saints are found in judgment seats;
No clear, straightforward speaker cheats.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Having thus made up his mind, he drew near to Godly,
      uttered the words: “Glory to Shiva. Amen,” fell flat on his
      face, and spoke with deference: “O holy sir! All life is
      vanity. Youth slips by like a mountain torrent. The days of
      our life are like a fire in chaff. Delights of the flesh are
      as the shadow of a cloud. Union with son, friend, servant,
      wife, is but a dream. All this I discern clearly. What shall
      I do that I may safely cross the sea of many lives?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>On hearing this, Godly said respectfully: “My son, blest
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n81.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x085" src="hertel2/n81.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      are you, being thus indifferent to the world  in early
      youth. What says the proverb?</p>
      <pre>
'Tis only saints in youth
That can be saints in truth:
Ah, who is not a saint
When ebbing passions faint?
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
First mind, then body ages
In case of holy sages:
The body ages first,
Mind never, in the worst.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“And as for your search to find a means of safely crossing
      the sea of many lives, just listen to this:</p>
      <pre>
A hangman with his matted hair,
Or serf, or other man, through prayer
To holy Shiva, changes caste,
Becomes pure Brahman at the last.

Six syllables, a little prayer;
A single blossom resting there
On Shiva's symbol&mdash;and on earth
No further pain, no later birth.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When he had listened to this, June clasped the holy man’s
      feet and said deferentially: “This being so, holy sir, pray
      do me the favor of imposing a vow.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“My son,” answered Godly, “I am ready to oblige you. But
      you must not enter my cell by night. For renunciation is
      recommended to ascetics, to you and to me as well. As the
      proverb puts it:</p>
      <pre>
Ascetics come to grief through greed;
And kings, who evil counsels heed;
Children through petting, wives through wine,
Through wicked sons a noble line;
A Brahman through unstudied books,
A character through haunting crooks;
A farm is ruined through neglect;
And friendship, lacking kind respect;
Love dies through absence; fortunes crash
Through naughtiness; and hoarded cash
Through carelessness or giving rash.
</pre>

      <p>So, after taking the vow, you must sleep in a hut of
      thatch at the monastery gate.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Holy sir,” said the other, “your prescription is the law
      of my life. I shall need it in the next world.” So, the
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n82.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x086" src="hertel2/n82.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      sleeping arrangements being made, Godly  graciously gave
      him initiation and granted discipleship. June for his part
      made the holy man very happy by rubbing his hands and feet,
      bringing writing-paper, and other services. Still, Godly kept
      his treasure under his arm.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>As the time passed in this manner, June reflected: “Dear
      me! Do what I will, he does not trust me. So shall I kill him
      with a knife in broad daylight? Or give him poison? Or
      butcher him like a beast?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>While he was reflecting thus, the son of a pupil of
      Godly’s came from the village, bearing an invitation. And he
      said: “Holy sir, pray come to my house for the ceremony of
      the sacred thread.” And when Godly heard this, he started
      with June.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now as he traveled, he came to a river, seeing which he
      took the treasure from under his arm, wrapped it carefully in
      his patched ascetic robe, worshiped the appropriate gods, and
      said to June: “June, I must step aside. Please keep careful
      watch of this robe and of the necessary until I return.” With
      these words he moved away. And as soon as he was out of
      sight, June seized the treasure and decamped.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

    <div id="the-jackal-at-the-ram-fight">
      <h2><a href="#TOC">The Jackal at the Ram-fight</a></h2>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now Godly sat down perfectly carefree, for his disciple’s
      countless virtues had lulled his suspicions. As he rested, he
      saw a herd of rams, and two of them fighting. These two would
      angrily draw apart and dash together, their slablike
      foreheads crashing so that blood flowed freely. This
      spectacle attracted a jackal whose soul was in the fetters of
      carnivorous desire, and he stood between the two, lapping up
      the blood.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When Godly observed this, he thought: “Well, well! This is
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n83.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x087" src="hertel2/n83.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      a dull-witted jackal. If he happens to be  between just
      when they crash, he will certainly meet death. This inference
      seems inescapable to me.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now the next time, being greedy as ever to lap up the
      blood, the jackal did not move away, was caught between the
      crashing heads, and was killed. Then Godly said: “The jackal
      at the ram-fight,” and grieving for him, started to resume
      his treasure.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>He returned in no haste, but when he failed to find June,
      he hurried through a ceremony of purification, then examined
      his robe. Finding the treasure gone, he fell to the ground in
      a swoon, murmuring: “Oh, oh! I am robbed.” In a moment he
      came to himself, rose again, and started to scream: “June,
      June! Where did you go after cheating me? Give me answer!”
      With this repeated lamentation he moved slowly on, picking up
      his disciple’s tracks and muttering: “And we, when tricked by
      June.”</p>

    <div id="the-weavers-wife">
      <h2><a href="#TOC">The Weaver’s Wife</a></h2>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now as he walked along, Godly spied a weaver who with his
      wife was on his way to a neighboring city for liquor to
      drink, and he called out: “Look here, my good fellow! I come
      to you a guest, brought by the evening sun. I do not know a
      soul in the village. Let me receive the treatment due a
      guest. For the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
No stranger may be turned aside
Who seeks your door at eventide;
Nay, honor him and you shall be
Transmuted into deity.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
Some straw, a floor, and water,
    With kindly words beside:
These four are never wanting
    Where pious folk abide.
</pre>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n84.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x088" src="hertel2/n84.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>And once again: </p>
      <pre>
The sacred fires by kindly word
And Indra by the chair is stirred,
Krishna by water for the feet,
The Lord of All by things to eat.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>On hearing this, the weaver said to his wife: “Go, my
      dear. Take this guest to the house. Treat him hospitably,
      giving him water for the feet, food, a bed, and so on. And
      stay in the house yourself. I will bring plenty of wine and
      meat for you.” With this he went farther.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So the wife started home with Godly, and she showed a
      laughing countenance, for she was a whore and had a certain
      swain in mind. Indeed, there is sense in the verse:</p>
      <pre>
When night is dark
    And dark the day,
When streets are mired
    With sticky clay,
When husband lingers
    Far away,
The flirt becomes
    Supremely gay.

The wench cares not
    A straw to miss
The covered couch,
    The husband's kiss,
The pleasant bed;
    In place of this
She ever seeks
    A stolen bliss.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
For stranger men
    The slut will see
The ruin of
    Her family,
The world's reproach,
    The jailer's key&mdash;
Will risk a death
    She cannot flee.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then she went home, offered Godly a rickety cot and said:
      “My holy sir, a woman friend has come from the village and I
      must speak to her. I will be back directly. Meanwhile, you
      may stay in our house. But please be careful.” With this she
      put on her best things and started to find her swain.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>At this moment she ran into her husband, clasping a jug of
      wine. He was reeling drunk, his hair was towsled, and he
      stumbled at every step. She ran when she saw him, entered the
      house, took off her finery, and appeared as usual.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now the weaver had seen her flee, had observed the finery,
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n85.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x089" src="hertel2/n85.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      and since he had previously heard the  gossip that went
      the rounds about her, his heart was troubled and anger
      overcame him. So he entered the house and said: “You wench!
      You whore! Where were you going?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>And she replied: “I have not been out since I left you.
      What is this drunken twaddle? There is sense in the
      proverb:</p>
      <pre>
After wine and fever, these
    Selfsame symptoms come:
Shaking, falling to the ground,
    Mad delirium.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
The setting sun and drunken man
    Are both a fiery red;
They sink in naked helplessness;
    Their dignity is dead.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When he had taken the scolding and had noticed her change
      of dress, he said: “Whore! I have heard gossip about you for
      a long time. Today I have seen the proof. I am going to give
      you what you deserve.” So he beat her limp with a club, tied
      her firmly to a post, and fell into a drunken slumber.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>At this juncture her friend, the barber’s wife, learning
      that the weaver was asleep, came in and said: “My dear, he is
      waiting for you over there—you know who. Go at once.” But the
      weaver’s wife replied: “Just see what a fix I am in. How can
      I go? You must return and tell my adorer that I cannot
      possibly meet him there at this moment.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“My dear,” said the barber’s wife, “do not say things like
      that. For a wench of spirit this is no way to behave. As the
      saying goes:</p>
      <pre>
Those who earn the name of blessed
    Show a camel-like persistence
When they pluck the fruit of pleasure,
    Counting neither toil nor distance.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
As the other world is doubtful
    And as scandal misses truth,
When you've hooked another's lover,
    Best enjoy the fruit of youth.
</pre>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n86.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x090" src="hertel2/n86.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>And once again: </p>
      <pre>
Fate may rob him of his manhood,
He may handsome be or ugly,
Yet a wench, whate'er it cost her,
Entertains her lover snugly.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Very fine indeed,” said the weaver’s wife. “But tell me
      how I am to go when I am tied fast. And here lies my
      husband—the brute!” “My dear,” said the barber’s wife, “he is
      helpless with drink and will not wake until the sun’s rays
      reach him. I will set you free and take your place myself.
      But you must hurry back when you have entertained your
      admirer.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>This she did, and a moment later the weaver rose a little
      mollified, and said drunkenly: “Come, you nagger! If you will
      stay at home after today and stop nagging, I will set you
      free.” The barber’s wife said nothing, fearing that her voice
      would betray her. Even when he repeated his offer, she made
      no answer. Then he became angry and cut off her nose with a
      sharp knife. And he said: “Whore! Now you can stay there. I
      shall not be nice to you again.” So he fell asleep,
      muttering. Now Godly, having lost his money, was so tormented
      by hunger that he could not sleep, and was a witness of all
      that the women did.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Presently the weaver’s wife, after enjoying the full
      delight of love with her swain, came home and said to the
      barber’s wife: “Well, are you all right? I hope that brute
      did not get up while I was gone.” And the barber’s wife
      answered: “The rest of me is all right. But I’ve lost my
      nose. Set me free quick, before he wakes up. I want to go
      home. If not, he will do something worse next time, cut off
      ears and things.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n87.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x091" src="hertel2/n87.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>So the wench freed the barber’s wife, took her 
      former position, and cried reproachfully: “Oh, you dreadful
      simpleton! I am a true wife, a model of faithfulness. What
      man is able to violate or disfigure me? Listen, ye guardian
      deities of the world!</p>
      <pre>
Earth, heaven, and death, the feeling mind,
Sun, moon, and water, fire and wind,
Both twilights, justice, day and night
Discern man's conduct, wrong or right.
</pre>

      <p>So, if I am a faithful wife, may these gods make my nose
      grow again as it was before. More than that, if I have had so
      much as a secret desire for a strange man, may they reduce me
      to ashes.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>After this explosion, she said to him directly: “Look, you
      villain! By virtue of my faithfulness my nose has grown as it
      was before.” And when he took a torch and examined her, he
      found her nose as it was originally, and a great pool of
      blood on the floor. At this he was amazed, released her from
      the cords, and flattered her with a hundred wheedling
      endearments.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now Godly had seen the whole business. And he was amazed
      and said:</p>
      <pre>
“Learn science with the gods above
    Or imps in nether space,
Yet women's wit will rival it:
    How keep them in their place?

Behold the faults with woman born:
Impurity, and heartless scorn,
Untruth, and folly, reckless heat,
Excessive greediness, deceit.

Be not enslaved by women's charm,
Nor wish them growth in power to harm:
Their slaves, of manly feeling stripped,
Are tame, pet crows whose wings are clipped.

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n88.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x092" src="hertel2/n88.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>Honey in a woman's words,                               
    Poison in her breast:
So, although you taste her lip,
    Drub her on the chest.

This palace filled with vice, this field where sprouts
Suspicion's crop, this whirling pool of doubts,
This town of recklessness, sin's aggregate,
This house where frauds by hundreds lie in wait,
This basketful of riddling sham and quip
O'er guessing which our best and bravest trip,
This woman, this machine, this nectar-bane&mdash;
Who set it here, to make religion vain?

A bosom hard is praised, a forehead low,
A fickle glance, a mumbling speech and slow,
Thick hips, a heart that constant tremors move,
A natural twist in hair, and twists in love.
Their virtues are a pack of vices. Then
Let beasts adore the fawn-eyed things, not men.

For reasons good they laugh or weep;
They trust you not, your trust they keep:
These graveyard urns, oh, haunt them not!
Keep kin and conduct free from spot.

The lion o'er whose awful face
    Falls fierce the towsled mane,
The elephant upon whose cheeks
    Streams ichor's glistening rain,
The men of wit or courage who
    In books or battles gleam,
In presence of their females, all
    Turn into cowards supreme.
</pre>

      <p>And once more:</p>
      <pre>
This gunja-fruit (oh, what was God about?)
Is poisonous within, and sweet without.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>In these meditations the night dragged drearily for the
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n89.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x093" src="hertel2/n89.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      holy man. Meanwhile the go-between went  home with her
      nose cut off, and reflected: “What is to be done now? How is
      this great deficiency to be concealed?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>The night during which she pondered thus, her husband
      spent in the king’s palace, practicing his trade. At dawn he
      came home and, being eager to begin his thriving business
      with the townspeople, he stopped at the door and called to
      her: “My dear, bring me my razor-case at once. The
      townspeople need my services.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Hereupon an idea occurred to the noseless woman. She
      remained in the house, but sent him a single razor. And the
      barber, angry because the entire case had not been delivered,
      flung the razor in her direction. This gave the wench her
      opportunity. Lifting her hands to heaven, she dashed from the
      house, screaming with all her might: “Oh, oh, oh! The
      ruffian! I was always a faithful wife. Look! He cut off my
      nose. Save me, save me!”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Hereupon the police arrived, thrashed the barber limp,
      tied him fast, and took him to court with his wife whose nose
      was gone. And the judges asked him: “Why did you do this
      ghastly thing to your wife?” Then, his wits being so addled
      by astonishment that he could give no answer, the jurymen
      quoted law:</p>
      <pre>
“The guilty man is terrified
By reason of his crime. His pride
Is gone, his powers of speaking fail,
His glances rove, his face is pale.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
The sweat appears upon his brow,
He stumbles on, he knows not how,
His face is pale, and all he utters
Is much distorted; for he stutters.

The culprit always may be found
To shake, and gaze upon the ground:
Observe the signs as best you can
And shrewdly pick the guilty man.
</pre>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n90.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x094" src="hertel2/n90.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>While, on the other hand: </p>
      <pre>
The innocent is self-reliant;
His speech is clear, his glance defiant;
His countenance is calm and free;
His indignation makes his plea.
</pre>

      <p>The prisoner is obviously guilty. The legal penalty for
      assaulting a woman is death. Let him be impaled.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>But Godly, seeing him led to the place of execution, went
      to the officers of justice and said: “Gentlemen, you make a
      mistake in putting this wretched barber to death. His conduct
      has been correct. Pray listen to these words of mine:</p>
      <pre>
The jackal at the ram-fight;
And we, when tricked by June;
The meddling friend&mdash;were playing
A self-defeating tune.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So the officers said: “How was that, holy sir?” Then Godly
      related to them the three stories, complete in every detail.
      And they were all astonished as they listened. They set the
      barber free, and said:</p>
      <pre>
“Slay not a woman, Brahman, child,
An invalid or hermit mild:
In case of major dereliction,
Disfigurement is the infliction.
</pre>

      <p>Now she has lost her nose through her own act. As
      additional punishment from the king, let her ears be cut
      off.” When this had been done, Godly, strengthening his
      spirit by the two examples, returned to his own
      monastery.</p>
      </div><div class="outer-frame-story">
  
      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“And that is why I say:</p>
      <pre>
The jackal at the ram-fight, ....
</pre>

      <p>and the rest of it.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Well,” said Cheek, “such being the case, what are you and
      I to do?” And Victor answered: “Even in these circumstances,
      I shall have a flash of intelligence, showing me how to
      separate Lively from the king. Besides, he has fallen into
      serious vice, has our master Rusty. For</p>
      <pre>
Mad folly stings
The greatest kings,
    Who then embrace a vice;
But servants' care
Should check them there
    By means of learning nice.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Into what vice has our master Rusty fallen?” asked Cheek.
      And Victor replied: “There are seven vices in the world,
      namely:</p>
      <pre>
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n91.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x095" src="hertel2/n91.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>Drink, women, hunting, scolding, dice,                  
Greed, cruelty: these seven are vice.
</pre>

      <p>These, however, really make a single vice, called
      ‘attachment,’ with seven subdivisions.” Then Cheek inquired:
      “Is there only a single fundamental vice, or are there others
      also?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>And Victor expounded: “There are in the world five
      situations fundamentally vicious.” And when Cheek asked: “How
      are they differentiated?” Victor continued: “They are called:
      (1) deficiency, (2) corruption, (3) attachment, (4)
      devastation, (5) mistaken policy.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“To begin at the beginning, the vice called ‘deficiency’
      means the non-existence of one or another of these: king,
      counselor, people, fortress, treasure, punitive power,
      friends.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Secondly, when subjects, whether foreign or native,
      become restless, whether individually or <em>en masse</em>,
      there arises the vicious situation called ‘corruption.’</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“‘Attachment’ was explained above, in the words:</p>
      <pre>
Drink, women, hunting, ....
</pre>

      <p>and the rest of it. Here there is a love-group (drink,
      women, hunting, dice) and a wrath-group (scolding, and the
      rest). A man thwarted in the love-group becomes obnoxious to
      the wrath-group. The love-group requires no elucidation. The
      wrath-group, however, threefold as already described, needs
      some further characterization. ‘Scolding’ is ill-considered
      imputation of fault on the part of one bent on injuring an
      antagonist. ‘Cruelty’ means ruthless and unwarranted
      refinements in putting to death, imprisonment, mutilation.
      ‘Greed’ is covetousness pushed to a merciless point. These
      are the seven subdivisions of the vice of attachment.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Next, there are eight kinds of devastation: by act of
      God, fire, water, disease, plague, panic, famine, devil-rain
      (which is a mere name for excessive rain). This disposes of
      the vice called ‘devastation.’</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Finally, there is mistaken policy. Where a man makes a
      mistaken use of the six expedients—peace, war, change of
      base, entrenchment, alliance, duplicity—adopting war instead
      of peace, or peace instead of war, or making similar mistakes
      in regard to the other expedients, there we have the vice of
      mistaken policy.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Now our master Rusty has fallen into the very first vice,
      that of deficiency. For he has been so captivated by Lively
      that he pays not the smallest heed to counselor or any other
      of the six supports of his throne. He adopts rather
      completely a vegetarian morality. So what is the use of a
      lengthy discussion? Rusty must by all means be detached from
      Lively. No lamp, no light.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“How will you detach him?” objected Cheek. “You have not
      the power.” “My dear fellow,” said Victor, “there is a verse
      to fit the situation, namely:</p>
      <pre>
In cases where brute force would fail,
    A shrewd device may still prevail:
The crow-hen used a golden chain,
    And so the dreadful snake was slain.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“How was that?” asked Cheek. And Victor told</p>

      ate their chicks as fast as they were born, even before
      baptism. Yet for all his sorrow over this violence, the poor
      crow could not desert the old familiar banyan and seek
      another tree. For</p>
      <pre>
Three cannot be induced to go&mdash;
The deer, the cowardly man, the crow:
Three go when insult makes them pant&mdash;
The lion, hero, elephant.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>At last the crow-hen fell at her husband’s feet and said:
      “My dear lord, a great many children of mine have been eaten
      by that awful snake. And grief for my loved and lost haunts
      me until I think of moving. Let us make our home in some
      other tree. For</p>
      <pre>
No friend like health abounding;
    And like disease, no foe;
No love like love of children;
    Like hunger-pangs, no woe.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
With fields overhanging rivers,
    With wife on flirting bent,
Or in a house with serpents,
    No man can be content.
</pre>

      <p>We are living in deadly peril.” At this the crow was
      dreadfully depressed, and he said: “We have lived in this
      tree a long time, my dear. We cannot desert it. For</p>
      <pre>
Where water may be sipped, and grass
    Be cropped, a deer might live content;
Yet insult will not drive him from
    The wood where all his life was spent.
</pre>

      <p>Moreover, by some shrewd device I will bring death upon
      this villainous and mighty foe.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n93.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x097" src="hertel2/n93.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>“But,” said his wife, “this is a terribly venomous 
      snake. How will you hurt him?” And he replied: “My dear, even
      if I have not the power to hurt him, still I have friends who
      possess learning, who have mastered the works on ethics. I
      will go and get from them some shrewd device of such nature
      that the villain—curse him!—will soon meet his doom.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>After this indignant speech he went at once to another
      tree, under which lived a dear friend, a jackal. He
      courteously called the jackal forth, related all his sorrow,
      then said: “My friend, what do you consider opportune under
      the circumstances? The killing of our children is sheer death
      to my wife and me.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“My friend,” said the jackal, “I have thought the matter
      through. You need not put yourself out. That villainous black
      snake is near his doom by reason of his heartless cruelty.
      For</p>
      <pre>
Of means to injure brutal foes
    You do not need to think,
Since of themselves they fall, like trees
    Upon the river's brink.
</pre>

      <p>And there is a story:</p>
      <pre>
A heron ate what fish he could,
The bad, indifferent, and good;
His greed was never satisfied
Till, strangled by a crab, he died.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“How was that?” asked the crow. And the jackal told the
      story of</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>
    </div>

    <div id="the-heron-that-liked-crab-meat">
      <h2><a href="#TOC">The Heron That Liked Crab-Meat</a></h2>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>There was once a heron in a certain place on the edge of a
      pond. Being old, he sought an easy way of catching fish on
      which to live. He began by lingering at the edge of his pond,
      pretending to be quite irresolute, not eating even the fish
      within his reach.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now among the fish lived a crab. He drew near and said:
      “Uncle, why do you neglect today your usual meals and
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n94.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x098" src="hertel2/n94.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      amusements?” And the heron replied:  “So long as I kept
      fat and flourishing by eating fish, I spent my time
      pleasantly, enjoying the taste of you. But a great disaster
      will soon befall you. And as I am old, this will cut short
      the pleasant course of my life. For this reason I feel
      depressed.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Uncle,” said the crab, “of what nature is the disaster?”
      And the heron continued: “Today I overheard the talk of a
      number of fishermen as they passed near the pond. ‘This is a
      big pond,’ they were saying, ‘full of fish. We will try a
      cast of the net tomorrow or the day after. But today we will
      go to the lake near the city.’ This being so, you are lost,
      my food supply is cut off, I too am lost, and in grief at the
      thought, I am indifferent to food today.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now when the water-dwellers heard the trickster’s report,
      they all feared for their lives and implored the heron,
      saying: “Uncle! Father! Brother! Friend! Thinker! Since you
      are informed of the calamity, you also know the remedy. Pray
      save us from the jaws of this death.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then the heron said: “I am a bird, not competent to
      contend with men. This, however, I can do. I can transfer you
      from this pond to another, a bottomless one.” By this artful
      speech they were so led astray that they said: “Uncle!
      Friend! Unselfish kinsman! Take me first! Me first! Did you
      never hear this?</p>
      <pre>
Stout hearts delight to pay the price
Of merciful self-sacrifice,
Count life as nothing, if it end
In gentle service to a friend.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then the old rascal laughed in his heart, and took counsel
      with his mind, thus: “My shrewdness has brought these fishes
      into my power. They ought to be eaten very comfortably.”
      Having thus thought it through, he promised what the
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n95.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x099" src="hertel2/n95.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      thronging fish implored,  lifted some in his bill,
      carried them a certain distance to a slab of stone, and ate
      them there. Day after day he made the trip with supreme
      delight and satisfaction, and meeting the fish, kept their
      confidence by ever new inventions.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>One day the crab, disturbed by the fear of death,
      importuned him with the words: “Uncle, pray save me, too,
      from the jaws of death.” And the heron reflected: “I am quite
      tired of this unvarying fish diet. I should like to taste
      him. He is different, and choice.” So he picked up the crab
      and flew through the air.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>But since he avoided all bodies of water and seemed
      planning to alight on the sun-scorched rock, the crab asked
      him: “Uncle, where is that pond without any bottom?” And the
      heron laughed and said: “Do you see that broad, sun-scorched
      rock? All the water-dwellers have found repose there. Your
      turn has now come to find repose.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then the crab looked down and saw a great rock of
      sacrifice, made horrible by heaps of fish-skeletons. And he
      thought: “Ah me!</p>
      <pre>
Friends are foes and foes are friends
As they mar or serve your ends;
Few discern where profit tends.
</pre>

      <p>Again:</p>
      <pre>
If you will, with serpents play;
Dwell with foemen who betray:
Shun your false and foolish friends,
Fickle, seeking vicious ends.
</pre>

      <p>Why, he has already eaten these fish whose skeletons are
      scattered in heaps. So what might be an opportune course of
      action for me? Yet why do I need to consider?</p>
      <pre>
Man is bidden to chastise
Even elders who devise
Devious courses, arrogant,
Of their duty ignorant.
</pre>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n96.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x100" src="hertel2/n96.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>Again: </p>
      <pre>
Fear fearful things, while yet
    No fearful thing appears;
When danger must be met,
    Strike, and forget your fears.
</pre>

      <p>So, before he drops me there, I will catch his neck with
      all four claws.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When he did so, the heron tried to escape, but being a
      fool, he found no parry to the grip of the crab’s nippers,
      and had his head cut off.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then the crab painfully made his way back to the pond,
      dragging the heron’s neck as if it had been a lotus-stalk.
      And when he came among the fish, they said: “Brother, why
      come back?” Thereupon he showed the head as his credentials
      and said: “He enticed the water-dwellers from every quarter,
      deceived them with his prevarications, dropped them on a slab
      of rock not far away, and ate them. But I—further life being
      predestined—perceived that he destroyed the trustful, and I
      have brought back his neck. Forget your worries. All the
      water-dwellers shall live in peace.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“And that is why I say:</p>
      <pre>
A heron ate what fish he could, ....
</pre>

      <p>and the rest of it.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“My friend,” said the crow, “tell me how this villainous
      snake is to meet his doom.” And the jackal answered: “Go to
      some spot frequented by a great monarch. There seize a golden
      chain or a necklace from some wealthy man who guards it
      carelessly. Deposit this in such a place that when it is
      recovered, the snake may be killed.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So the crow and his wife straightway flew off at random,
      and the wife came upon a certain pond. As she looked about,
      she saw the women of a king’s court playing in the water, and
      on the bank they had laid golden chains, pearl necklaces,
      garments, and gems. One chain of gold the crow-hen seized and
      started for the tree where she lived.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>But when the chamberlains and the eunuchs saw the theft,
      they picked up clubs and ran in pursuit. Meanwhile, the
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n97.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x101" src="hertel2/n97.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      crow-hen dropped the golden chain  in the snake’s hole
      and waited at a safe distance.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now when the king’s men climbed the tree, they found a
      hole and in it a black snake with swelling hood. So they
      killed him with their clubs, recovered the golden chain, and
      went their way. Thereafter the crow and his wife lived in
      peace.</p>

    </div>

    <div id="numskull-and-the-rabbit">
      <h2><a href="#TOC">Numskull and the Rabbit</a></h2>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>In a part of a forest was a lion drunk with pride, and his
      name was Numskull. He slaughtered the animals without
      ceasing. If he saw an animal, he could not spare him.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So all the natives of the forest—deer, boars, buffaloes,
      wild oxen, rabbits, and others—came together, and with
      woe-begone countenances, bowed heads, and knees clinging to
      the ground, they undertook to beseech obsequiously the king
      of beasts: “Have done, O King, with this merciless,
      meaningless slaughter of all creatures. It is hostile to
      happiness in the other world. For the Scripture says:</p>
      <pre>
A thousand future lives
    Will pass in wretchedness
For sins a fool commits
    His present life to bless.
</pre>

      <p>Again:</p>
      <pre>
What wisdom in a deed
    That brings dishonor fell,
That causes loss of trust,
    That paves the way to hell?
</pre>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n98.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x102" src="hertel2/n98.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>And yet again: </p>
      <pre>
The ungrateful body, frail
    And rank with filth within,
Is such that only fools
    For its sake sink in sin.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Consider these facts, and cease, we pray, to slaughter
      our generations. For if the master will remain at home, we
      will of our own motion send him each day for his daily food
      one animal of the forest. In this way neither the royal
      sustenance nor our families will be cut short. In this way
      let the king’s duty be performed. For the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
The king who tastes his kingdom like
    Elixir, bit by bit,
Who does not overtax its life,
Will fully relish it.

The king who madly butchers men,
    Their lives as little reckoned
As lives of goats, has one square meal,
    But never has a second.

A king desiring profit, guards
    His world from evil chance;
With gifts and honors waters it
    As florists water plants.

Guard subjects like a cow, nor ask
    For milk each passing hour:
A vine must first be sprinkled, then
    It ripens fruit and flower.

The monarch-lamp from subjects draws
    Tax-oil to keep it bright:
Has any ever noticed kings
    That shone by inner light?

A seedling is a tender thing,
    And yet, if not neglected,
It comes in time to bearing fruit:
    So subjects well protected.

Their subjects form the only source
    From which accrue to kings
Their gold, grain, gems, and varied drinks,
    And many other things.

The kings who serve the common weal,
    Luxuriantly sprout;
The common loss is kingly loss,
    Without a shade of doubt.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>After listening to this address, Numskull said: “Well,
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n99.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x103" src="hertel2/n99.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      gentlemen, you are quite convincing. But if  an animal
      does not come to me every day as I sit here, I promise you I
      will eat you all.” To this they assented with much relief,
      and fearlessly roamed the wood. Each day at noon one of them
      appeared as his dinner, each species taking its turn and
      providing an individual grown old, or religious, or
      grief-smitten, or fearful of the loss of son or wife.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>One day a rabbit’s turn came, it being rabbit-day. And
      when all the thronging animals had given him directions, he
      reflected: “How is it possible to kill this lion—curse him!
      Yet after all,</p>
      <pre>
In what can wisdom not prevail?
In what can resolution fail?
What cannot flattery subdue?
What cannot enterprise put through?
</pre>

      <p>I can kill even a lion.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So he went very slowly, planning to arrive tardily, and
      meditating with troubled spirit on a means of killing him.
      Late in the day he came into the presence of the lion, whose
      throat was pinched by hunger in consequence of the delay, and
      who angrily thought as he licked his chops: “Aha! I must kill
      all the animals the first thing in the morning.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>While he was thinking, the rabbit slowly drew near, bowed
      low, and stood before him. But when the lion saw that he was
      tardy and too small at that for a meal, his soul flamed with
      wrath, and he taunted the rabbit, saying: “You reprobate!
      First, you are too small for a meal. Second, you are tardy.
      Because of this wickedness I am going to kill you, and
      tomorrow morning I shall extirpate every species of
      animal.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then the rabbit bowed low and said with deference:
      “Master, the wickedness is not mine, nor the other animals’.
      Pray hear the cause of it.” And the lion answered: “Well,
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n100.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x104" src="hertel2/n100.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      tell it quick, before you are  between my fangs.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Master,” said the rabbit, “all the animals recognized
      today that the rabbits’ turn had come, and because I was
      quite small, they dispatched me with five other rabbits. But
      in mid-journey there issued from a great hole in the ground a
      lion who said: ‘Where are you bound? Pray to your favorite
      god.’ Then I said: ‘We are traveling as the dinner of lion
      Numskull, our master, according to agreement.’ ‘Is that so?’
      said he. ‘This forest belongs to me. So all the animals,
      without exception, must deal with me—according to agreement.
      This Numskull is a sneak thief. Call him out and bring him
      here at once. Then whichever of us proves stronger, shall be
      king and shall eat all these animals.’ At his command,
      master, I have come to you. This is the cause of my
      tardiness. For the rest, my master is the sole judge.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>After listening to this, Numskull said: “Well, well, my
      good fellow, show me that sneak thief of a lion, and be quick
      about it. I cannot find peace of mind until I have vented on
      him my anger against the animals. He should have remembered
      the saying:</p>
      <pre>
Land and friends and gold at most
    Have been won when battles cease;
If but one of these should fail,
    Do not think of breaking peace.

Where no great reward is won,
    Where defeat is nearly sure,
Never stir a quarrel, but
    Find it wiser to endure.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Quite so, master,” said the rabbit. “Warriors fight for
      their country when they are insulted. But this fellow skulks
      in a fortress. You know he came out of a fortress when he
      held us up. And an enemy in a fortress is hard to handle. As
      the saying goes:</p>
      <pre>
A single royal fortress adds
    More military force
Than do a thousand elephants,
    A hundred thousand horse.

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n101.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x105" src="hertel2/n101.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>A single archer from a wall                             
    A hundred foes forfends;
And so the military art
    A fortress recommends.

God Indra used the wit and skill
    Of gods in days of old,
When Devil Gold-mat plagued the world,
    To build a fortress-hold.

And he decreed that any king
    Who built a fortress sound,
Should conquer foemen. This is why
    Such fortresses abound.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When he heard this, Numskull said: “My good fellow, show
      me that thief. Even if he is hiding in a fortress, I will
      kill him. For the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
The strongest man who fails to crush
    At birth, disease or foe,
Will later be destroyed by that
    Which he permits to grow.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
The man who reckons well his power,
    Nor pride nor vigor lacks,
May single-handed smite his foes
    Like Rama-with-the-axe.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Very true,” said the rabbit. “But after all it was a
      mighty lion that I saw. So the master should not set out
      without realizing the enemy’s capacity. As the saying
      runs:</p>
      <pre>
A warrior failing to compare
    Two hosts, in mad desire
For battle, plunges like a moth
    Headforemost into fire.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
The weak who challenge mighty foes
    A battle to abide,
Like elephants with broken tusks,
    Return with drooping pride.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>But Numskull said: “What business is it of yours? Show him
      to me, even in his fortress.” “Very well,” said the rabbit.
      “Follow me, master.” And he led the way to a well, where he
      said to the lion: “Master, who can endure your majesty? The
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n102.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x106" src="hertel2/n102.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      moment  he saw you, that thief crawled clear into his
      hole. Come, I will show him to you.” “Be quick about it, my
      good fellow,” said Numskull.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So the rabbit showed him the well. And the lion, being a
      dreadful fool, saw his own reflection in the water, and gave
      voice to a great roar. Then from the well issued a roar twice
      as loud, because of the echo. This the lion heard, decided
      that his rival was very powerful, hurled himself down, and
      met his death. Thereupon the rabbit cheerfully carried the
      glad news to all the animals, received their compliments, and
      lived there contentedly in the forest.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“And that is why I say:</p>
      <pre>
Intelligence is power, ...,
</pre>

      <p>and the rest of it.”</p>
      </div><div class="outer-frame-story">

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“But,” said Cheek, “that is like a palm-fruit falling on a
      crow’s head—a quite exceptional case. Even if the rabbit was
      successful, still a man of feeble powers should not deal

      strong, one must make up his mind to vigorous action. You

Unceasing effort brings success;
    ‘Fate, fate is all,’ let dastards wail:
Smite fate and prove yourself a man;

      <p>Furthermore, the very gods befriend those who ever strive.

The gods befriend a man who climbs

      <h2><a href="#TOC">The Weaver Who Loved a Princess</a></h2>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n103.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x107" src="hertel2/n103.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>In the Molasses Belt is a city called Sugarcane 
      City. In it lived two friends, a weaver and a carpenter.
      Since they were past masters in their respective crafts, they
      had earned enough money by their labors so that they kept no
      account of receipt and expenditure. They wore soft, gaily
      colored, expensive garments, adorned themselves with flowers
      and betel-leaves, and diffused odors of camphor, aloes, and
      musk. They worked nine hours a day, after which they adorned
      their persons and met for recreation in such places as public
      squares or temples. They made the rounds of the spots where
      society gathered—theaters, <em>conversaziones</em>, birthday
      parties, banquets, and the like—then went home at twilight.
      And so the time passed.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>One day there was a great festival, an occasion when the
      entire population, wearing the finest ornaments that each
      could afford, began sauntering through the temples of the
      gods and other public places. The weaver and the carpenter,
      like the rest, put on their best things, and in squares and
      courtyards inspected the faces of people dressed to kill. And
      they caught a glimpse of a princess seated at the window of a
      stucco palace. The vicinity of her heart was made lovely by a
      firm bosom with the curve of early youth. Below the slender
      waist was the graceful swell of the hips. Her hair was black
      as a raincloud, soft, glossy, with a billowy curl. A golden
      earring danced below an ear that seemed a hammock where Love
      might swing. Her face had the charm of a new-blown, tender
      water-lily. Like a dream she took captive the eyes of all, as
      she sat surrounded by girl friends.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>And the weaver, ravished by lavish loveliness, since the
      love-god with five fierce arrows pierced his heart, concealed
      his feelings by a supreme effort of resolution, and tottered
      home, seeing nothing but the princess in the whole horizon.
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n104.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x108" src="hertel2/n104.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      With long-drawn,  burning sighs he tumbled on the bed
      (though it had not been made up), and there he lay. He
      perceived, he thought of nothing but her, just as he had seen
      her, and there he lay, reciting poetry:</p>
      <pre>
Virtues with beauty dwell:
    So poets sing,
This contradiction not
    Considering:
That she, so cruel-sweet,
    Far, far apart,
Tortures my body still,
    Still in my heart.
</pre>

      <p>Or does this explain it?</p>
      <pre>
One heart my darling took;
    One pines as if to die;
One throbs with feeling pure:
    How many hearts have I?
</pre>

      <p>And yet</p>
      <pre>
If all the world from virtue draws
    A blessing and a gain,
Why should all virtue in my maid,
    My fawn-eyed maiden, pain?

Each guards his home, they say;
Yet in my heart you stay,
Burning your home alway,
Sweet, heartless one!

That these&mdash;her bosom's youthful pride,
Her curling hair, her sinuous side,
Her blood-red lip, her waist so small&mdash;
Should hurt me, is not strange at all:
But that her cheeks so clear, so bright,
Should torture me, is far from right.

Her bosom, like an elephant's brow,
Swells, saffron-scented. How, ah, how
May I thereon my bosom lay,
When weary love is tired of play,
So, fettered in her arms, to keep
A vigil waking half, half sleep?

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n105.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x109" src="hertel2/n105.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>If fate has willed                                      
    That I should die,
Are there no means
    Save that soft eye?

You see my love, though far apart,
Before you ever, O my heart!
Should vision cease to satisfy,
Oh, teach your magic to my eye:
For even her presence will distress,
If bought by too great loneliness,
Since none&mdash;the merciful are blest&mdash;
Of selfishness may stand confessed.

She stole his luster from the moon&mdash;
    The moon is dull and cold;
The lily's sheen is in her eyes&mdash;
    No charge of theft will hold;
The elephant's majesty she seized&mdash;
    Naught knows he of her art;
From me the slender maiden took,
    Ah, strange! a feeling heart.

In middle air I see my love,
On earth below, in heaven above;
In life's last hour, on her I call:
She is, like Vishnu, all-in-all.

All mental states, the Buddha said,
    Are transient; he was wrong:
My meditations on my love
    Are infinitely long.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>In such lamentation, his thoughts tossing to and fro, the
      night dragged drearily away. On the next day at the customary
      hour, the carpenter, wearing an elegant costume, came as
      usual to the weaver’s house. There he found the weaver with
      arms and legs sprawled over the unmade bed, heard his
      long-drawn, burning sighs, and noticed his pallid cheeks and
      trickling tears. Finding him in this condition, he said: “My
      friend, my friend, why are you in such a state today?” But
      the poor weaver, though questioned repeatedly, was too
      embarrassed to say a word. At last the carpenter grew weary
      and dropped into poetry:</p>
      <pre>
No friend is he whose anger
Compels a timid languor,
    Nor he whom all must anxiously attend;
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n106.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x110" src="hertel2/n106.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>But when you trust another                              
As if he were your mother,
    He is no mere acquaintance, but a friend.
</pre>

      <p>Then, after examining the weaver’s heart and other members
      with a hand skilled in detecting symptoms, he said: “Comrade,
      if my diagnosis is correct, your condition is not the result
      of fever, but of love.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now when his friend voluntarily introduced the subject,
      the weaver sat up in bed and recited a stanza of poetry:</p>
      <pre>
You find repose in sore disaster
By telling things to clear-eyed master,
To virtuous servant, gentle friend,
Or wife who loves you to the end.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then he related his whole experience from the moment he
      laid eyes on the princess. And the carpenter, after some
      reflection, said: “The king belongs to the warrior caste,
      while you are a business man. Have you no reverence for the
      holy law?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>But the weaver replied: “The holy law allows a warrior
      three wives. The girl may be the daughter of a woman of my
      caste. That may explain my love for her. What says the king
      in the play?</p>
      <pre>
Surely, she may become a warrior's bride;
    Else, why these longings in an honest mind?
The motions of a blameless heart decide
    Of right and wrong, when reason leaves us blind.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Thereupon the carpenter, perceiving his determined
      purpose, said: “Comrade, what is to be done next?” And the
      weaver answered: “I don’t know. I told you because you are my
      friend.” And to this he would not add a word.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>At last the carpenter said: “Rise, bathe, eat. Say
      farewell to despondency. I will invent something such that
      you will enjoy with her the delights of love without loss of
      time.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n107.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x111" src="hertel2/n107.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>Then the weaver, hope reviving at his friend’s 
      promise, rose and returned to seemly living. And the next day
      the carpenter came bringing a brand-new mechanical bird, like
      Garuda, the bird of Vishnu. It was made of wood, was gaily
      painted in many colors, and had an ingenious arrangement of
      plugs.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Comrade,” he said to the weaver, “when you mount the bird
      and insert a plug, it goes wherever you wish. And the
      contrivance alights at the spot where you pull out the plug.
      It is yours. This very night, when people are asleep, adorn
      your person, disguise yourself as Vishnu—my wit and skill are
      at your service—mount this Garuda bird, alight on the
      maidens’ balcony of the palace, and make whatever
      arrangements you like with the princess. I have ascertained
      that the princess sleeps alone on the palace balcony.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When the carpenter had gone, the weaver spent the rest of
      the day in a hundred fond imaginings. He took a bath, used
      incense, powders, ointments, betel, scents for the breath,
      flowers, and so forth. He put on gay garlands and garments,
      rich in fragrance. He adorned himself with a diadem and other
      jewelry. And when the night came clear, he followed the
      carpenter’s instructions.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the princess lay in her bed alone on the palace
      balcony bathed in moonbeams. She gazed at the moon, her mind
      idly dallying with the thought of love. All at once she spied
      the weaver, disguised as Vishnu and mounted on his heavenly
      bird. At sight of him she started from her bed, adored his
      feet, and humbly said: “O Lord, to what end am I honored by
      this visit? Pray command me. What am I to do?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>To the princess’ words the weaver, in dignified and
      sweetly modulated accents, made stately answer: “Yourself,
      dear maiden, are the occasion of this visit to earth.” “But I
      am merely a mortal girl,” said she. And he continued: “Nay,
      you have been my bride, now fallen to earth by reason of a
      curse. It is I who have so long protected you from contact
      with a man. I will now wed you by the ceremony used in
      heaven.” And she assented, for she thought: “It is a thing
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n108.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x112" src="hertel2/n108.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>       beyond my fondest aspirations.” And he married her by
      the ceremony used in heaven.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So day followed day in the enjoyment of love’s delights,
      each day witnessing a growth in passion. Before dawn the
      weaver would mount his mechanical Garuda, would bid her
      farewell with the words: “I depart for Vishnu’s heaven,” and
      would always reach his house undetected.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>One day the guards at the women’s quarters observed
      indications that the princess was meeting a man, and in fear
      of their very lives made a report to their master. “O King,”
      they said, “be gracious and confirm our personal security.
      There is a disclosure to be made.” And when the king
      assented, the guards reported: “O King, we have used anxious
      care to forbid the entrance of men. Yet indications are
      observed that Princess Lovely has meetings with a man. Not
      unto us does it fall to take measures. The king, the king
      alone is prime mover.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Upon this information the king pondered with troubled
      spirit:</p>
      <pre>
You are worried when you hear that she is born;
Picking husbands makes you anxious and forlorn;
When she marries, will her husband be a churl?
It is tough to be the father of a girl.
</pre>

      <p>Again:</p>
      <pre>
At her birth she steals away her mother's heart;
Loving friends, when she is older, fall apart;
Even married, she is apt to bring a stain:
Having daughters is a business full of pain.
</pre>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n109.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x113" src="hertel2/n109.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>Again: </p>
      <pre>
When a poem or daughter comes out,
The author is troubled with doubt,
    With a doubt that his questions betray;
Will she reach the right hands?
Will she please as she stands?
    And what will the critics say?
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Having thus considered the matter from every point of
      view, he sought the queen and said: “My dear queen, pray give
      careful attention to what these chamberlains have to say. Who
      is this offender whom the death-god seeks today?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now when they had related the facts, the queen hastened in
      great perturbation to the maiden’s apartments and found her
      daughter with lips sore from kissing and with telltale traces
      on her limbs. And she cried: “You wicked girl! You are a
      disgrace to the family! How could you throw your character
      away? Who is the man that comes to you? The death-god has
      looked upon him. Dreadful as things are, at least tell the
      truth.” Then the princess, with shamefaced, drooping glances,
      recounted the whole story of the weaver disguised as
      Vishnu.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Thereupon the queen, with laughing countenance and
      thrilling in every limb, hastened to the king and said: “O
      King, you are indeed fortunate. It is blessed Vishnu who
      comes each night in person to our daughter’s side. He has
      married her by the ceremony used in heaven. This very night
      you and I are to hide in the window niche and have sight of
      him. But with mortals he does not exchange words.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>On hearing this, the king was glad at heart, and somehow
      lived through the day, which seemed a hundred years. When
      night came, the king and queen stood hidden in the window
      niche and waited, their gaze fixed on the sky. Presently the
      king descried one descending from heaven, mounted on Garuda,
      grasping the conch-shell, discus, mace, marked with the
      familiar symbols. And feeling as if drenched by a shower of
      nectar, he said to the queen: “There is none other on earth
      so blest as you and I, whose child blessed Vishnu seeks with
      love. All the desires nearest our hearts are granted. Now,
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n110.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x114" src="hertel2/n110.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      through the power of  our son-in-law, I shall reduce the
      whole world to subjection.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>At this juncture envoys arrived to collect the yearly
      tribute for King Valor, monarch of the south, lord of nine
      million, nine hundred thousand villages. But the king, proud
      of his new relationship with Vishnu, did not show them the
      customary honor, so that they grew indignant and said: “Come,
      King! Pay-day is past. Why have you failed to offer the taxes
      due? It must be that you have recently come into possession
      of some unanticipated, supernatural power from some source or
      other, that you irritate King Valor, who is a flame, a
      whirlwind, a venomous serpent, a death-god.” Upon this the
      king showed them his bare bottom. And they returned to their
      own country, exaggerated the matter a hundred thousand fold,
      and stirred the wrath of their master.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then the southern monarch, with his troops and retainers,
      at the head of an army with all four service branches,
      marched against the king. And he angrily cried:</p>
      <pre>
This king may climb the heavenly mount,
    May plunge beneath the sea;
And yet&mdash;I promise it&mdash;the wretch
    Shall soon be slain by me.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So Valor reached the country by marches never interrupted,
      and ravaged it. And the inhabitants who survived the
      slaughter besieged the palace gate of the king of Sugarcane
      City, and taunted him. But what he heard did not cause the
      king the slightest anxiety.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>On the following day the forces of King Valor arrived and
      invested Sugarcane City, whereupon hosts of counselors and
      chaplains interceded with the king: “O King,” they said, “a
      powerful enemy has arrived and invested the city. How can the
      king show himself so unconcerned?” And the king replied: “You
      gentlemen may be quite comfortable. I have devised a means of
      killing this foe. What I am about to do to his army, you,
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n111.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x115" src="hertel2/n111.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      too, will learn tomorrow morning.”  After this address,
      he bade them provide adequate defense for the walls and
      gates.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then he summoned Lovely and with respectful coaxing said:
      “Dear child, relying on your husband’s power, we have begun
      hostilities with the enemy. This very night pray speak to
      blessed Vishnu when he comes, so that in the morning he may
      kill this enemy of ours.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So Lovely delivered to him at night her father’s message,
      complete in every particular. On hearing it, the weaver
      laughed and said: “Dear love, how little a business is this,
      a mere war with men! Why, in days gone by I have with the
      greatest ease slain mighty demons by the thousand, and they
      were armed with magic; there was Hiranyakashipu, and Kansa,
      and Madhu, and Kaitabha, to name but a few. Go, then, and say
      to the king: ‘Dismiss anxiety. In the morning Vishnu will
      slay the host of your enemies with his discus.’”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So she went to the king and proudly told him all. Whereat
      he was overjoyed and commanded the doorkeeper to have
      proclamation made with beat of drum throughout the city, in
      these words: “Whatever any shall lay hands on during
      tomorrow’s battle in the camp of Valor slain, whether coined
      money or grain or gold or elephant or horse or weapon or
      other object, that shall remain his personal possession.”
      This proclamation delighted the citizens, so that they
      gossiped together, saying: “This king of ours is a lofty
      soul, unalarmed even in the presence of the hostile host. He
      is certain to kill his rival in the morning.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Meanwhile the weaver, forgetting love’s allurements, took
      counsel with his brooding mind: “What am I to do now? Suppose
      I mount the machine and fly away, then I shall never meet my
      pearl, my wife, again. King Valor will drag her from the
      palace after killing my poor father-in-law. Yet if I accept
      battle, I shall meet death, who puts an end to every heart’s
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n112.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x116" src="hertel2/n112.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>       desire. But death is mine if I lose her. Why spin it
      out? Death, sure death, in either case. It is better, then,
      to die game. Besides, it is just possible that the enemy, if
      they see me accepting battle and mounted on Garuda, will
      think me the genuine Vishnu and will flee. For the proverb
      says:</p>
      <pre>
Let resolution guide the great,
However desperate his state,
However grim his hostile fate:

By resolution lifted high,
With shrewd decision as ally,
He grimly sees grim trouble fly.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When the weaver had thus resolved on battle, the genuine
      Garuda made respectful representations to the genuine Vishnu
      in heaven. “O Lord,” he said, “in a city on earth called
      Sugarcane is a weaver who, disguising himself as my Lord, has
      wedded a princess. As a result, a more powerful monarch of
      the south has marched to extirpate the king of Sugarcane
      City. Now the weaver today takes his resolution to befriend
      his father-in-law. This, then, is what I must refer to your
      decision. If he meets death in battle, then scandal will
      arise in the mortal world to the effect that blessed Vishnu
      has been killed by the king of the south. Thereafter
      sacrificial offerings will fail, and other religious
      ceremonies. Then atheists will destroy the temples of the
      Lord, while pilgrims of the triple staff, devotees of blessed
      Vishnu, will abstain from pious journeyings. Such being the
      condition of affairs, decision rests with my Lord.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then blessèd Vishnu, after exhaustive meditation, spoke to
      Garuda: “O King of the winged, your reasoning is just. This
      weaver has a spark of divinity in him. Therefore he must be
      the slayer of yonder king. And to bring this about, you and I
      must befriend him. My spirit shall enter his body, you are to
      inspire his bird, and my discus, his discus.” “So be it,”
      said Garuda, assenting.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n113.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x117" src="hertel2/n113.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>Hereupon the weaver, inspired by Vishnu, gave 
      instructions to Lovely: “Dear love, when I set out for
      battle, let all things be made ready that bring a
      benediction.” He then performed auspicious ceremonies,
      assumed ornaments seemly for battle, and permitted worshipful
      offerings of yellow pigment, black mustard, flowers, and the
      like. But when the friend of day-blooming water-lilies, the
      blessed, thousand-beamed sun arose, adorning the bridal brow
      of the eastern sky, then to the victorious roll of the
      war-drums, the king issued from the city and drew near the
      field of battle, then both armies formed in exact array, then
      the infantry came to blows. At this moment the weaver,
      mounted on Garuda, and scattering largess of gold and
      precious gems, flew from the palace roof toward heaven’s
      vault, while the townspeople, thrilling with wonder, gazed
      and adored, then beyond the city he hovered above his army,
      and drew from Vishnu’s conch a proud, grand burst of martial
      sound.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>At the blare of the conch, elephants, horses, chariots,
      foot-soldiers, were dismayed and many garments were fouled.
      Some with shrill screams fled afar. Some rolled on the
      ground, all purposive movement paralyzed. Some stood stock
      still, with terrified gaze fixed unwavering on heaven.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>At this point all the gods were drawn to the spot by
      curiosity to see the fight, and Indra said to Brahma:
      “Brahma, is this some imp or demon who must needs be slain?
      For blessèd Vishnu, mounted on Garuda, has gone forth to
      battle in person.” At these words Brahma pondered:</p>
      <pre>
“Lord Vishnu's discus drinks in flood
The hostile demons' gushing blood,
    And strikes no mortal flat:
The jungle lion who can draw
The tusker's life with awful paw,
    Disdains to crush a gnat.
</pre>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n114.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x118" src="hertel2/n114.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>What means this marvel?” Thus Brahma himself was 
      astonished. That is why I told you:</p>
      <pre>
Not even Brahma sees the end
    Of well-devised deceit:
The weaver, taking Vishnu's form,
    Embraced the princess sweet.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>While the very gods were thus pondering with tense
      interest, the weaver hurled his discus at Valor. This discus,
      after cutting the king in twain, returned to his hand. At the
      sight, all the kings without exception leaped from their
      vehicles, and with hands, feet, and head drooping in limp
      obeisance, they implored him who bore the form of Vishnu: “O
      Lord,</p>
      <pre>
An army, leaderless, is slain.
</pre>

      <p>Be mindful of this and spare our lives. Command us. What
      are we to do?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So spoke the whole throng of kings, until he made answer
      who bore the form of Vishnu: “Your persons are secure
      henceforth. Whatever commands you receive from the local
      king, King Stout-Mail, you must on all occasions
      unhesitatingly perform.” And all the kings humbly received
      his instructions, saying: “Let it be as our Lord
      commands.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Thereupon the weaver bestowed on Stout-Mail all his
      rival’s wealth, whether men or elephants or chariots or
      horses or stores of merchandise or other riches, while he
      himself, having attained the special majesty of those
      victorious, enjoyed all known delights with the princess.</p>

     </div><div class="outer-frame-story">

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“And that is why I say:</p>
      <pre>
The gods befriend a man who climbs
    Determination's height, ....
</pre>

      <p>and the rest of it.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Having listened to this, Cheek said: “If you, too, are
      thus climbing determination’s height, then proceed to the
      accomplishment of your desire. Blest be your
      journeyings.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Thereupon Victor sought the presence of the lion, who
      said, when Victor had bowed and seated himself: “Why has so
      long a time passed since you were last visible?” And Victor
      answered: “O King, urgent business awaits my master today.
      Hence I am come, the bearer of tidings unwelcome but
      wholesome. This is not, indeed, the desire of dependents, who
      yet bring such tidings when they fear the neglect of
      immediate and necessary action. As the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n115.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x119" src="hertel2/n115.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>When those appointed to advise                          
Speak wholesome truth, they cause surprise
By this remarkable excess
Of passionate devotedness.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
A man is quickly found, O King,
To say the sycophantic thing;
But one prepared to hear or speak
Unwelcome truth, is far to seek.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Hereupon Rusty, believing his words worthy of trust,
      respectfully asked him: “What do you wish to imply?” And
      Victor answered: “O King, Lively has crept into your
      confidence with treasonable purpose. On several occasions he
      has confidentially whispered in my hearing: ‘I have examined
      the strong points and the weak in your master’s power—in his
      prestige, his advisers, and his material resources. I plan to
      kill him and to seize the royal power myself without
      difficulty.’ This very day this Lively person intends to
      carry out his design. That is why I am here to warn the
      master whose service is mine by inheritance.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>To Rusty this report was more terrible than the fall of a
      thunderbolt. He sank into a panic-stricken stupor and said
      not a word. Then Victor, comprehending his state of mind,
      continued: “This is the great sadness in the discharge of a
      counselor’s duty. There is wisdom in the saying:</p>
      <pre>
When a counselor or king
    Rises higher than he should,
Fortune strives in vain to make
    Still her double footing good;
Being woman, feels the strain;
Soon abandons one of twain.
</pre>

      <p>For, indeed,</p>
      <pre>
With broken sliver, loosened tooth,
Or counselor who fails in truth,
Pull roots and all; so only, grief
Will find its permanent relief.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
No king should ever delegate
To one sole man the powers of state:
For folly seizes him, then pride,
Whereat he grows dissatisfied
With service; thus impatient grown,
He longs to rule the realm alone;
And such impatient longings bring
Him into plots to kill his king.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Even now, this Lively manages all business as he will,
      without restraint of any kind. Hence the well-known saying
      finds application:</p>
      <pre>
A counselor who tramples through
His business, though his heart be true,
May not unheeded go his way,
Since future days the present pay.
</pre>

      <p>But such is the nature of kings. As the poet sings:</p>
      <pre>
Some gentle actions born of love
To thoughts of active hatred move;
Some deeds of traitorous offense
Win guerdon of benevolence;
The kingly mind can no man tame,
As never being twice the same:
Such service makes the spirit faint,
A hard conundrum for a saint.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>On hearing this, Rusty said: “After all, he is my servant.
      Why should he experience a change of heart toward me?” But
      Victor answered: “Servant or not, there is nothing conclusive
      in that. For the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n116.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x120" src="hertel2/n116.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>The man who loves not royalty,                          
    Just serving while he can
Find nothing better worth his pains,
    Is not a loyal man.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“My dear fellow,” said the lion, “even so, I cannot find
      it in my heart to turn against him. For</p>
      <pre>
However false and fickle grown,
    Once dear is always dear:
Who does not love his body, though
    Decrepit, blemished, queer?
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
His actions may be hard to bear,
    His speech be harsh to hear;
The heart still clings delighted to
    A person truly dear.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“For that very reason,” retorted Victor, “there is a
      serious flaw in the business of getting on in the world.
      Observe how this person, upon whom the master has
      concentrated his consideration to the exclusion of the whole
      company of animals, now desires to become himself the master.
      As the verse puts it:</p>
      <pre>
The man of birth or man unknown,
If kingly eyes on him alone
Are fixed, aspires to seize the throne.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Therefore, dear though he be, he should be abandoned,
      being a traitor, like one who has never been dear. There is
      much wisdom in the saying:</p>
      <pre>
Pursue your aim, abandoning
    The fools inclined to sin,
The comrades, brothers, friends, or sons,
    Or honorable kin:
You know the song the women sing,
    We hear it far and near&mdash;
What good are golden earrings, if
    They lacerate your ear?
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“And if you fancy that he will bring benefit because he is
      bulky of body, you make a perverse mistake. For</p>
      <pre>
How use a proud bull-elephant
    That will not serve the king?
A man is better, fat or lean,
    Who does the helpful thing.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Again, any pity that our lord and king might feel toward
      him, is quite out of place. For</p>
      <pre>
Whoever leaves the righteous path
    For some unrighteous course,
Will meet calamity in time
    And suffer much remorse.

Whoever will not take from friends
    Most excellent advice,
Will gladden foes, and falling soon,
    Will pay his folly's price.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
On wicked trick intently bent,
    The wilful still lack ear to hear
(So blind their mind) of nice and vice
    The cause in saws appearing clear.
</pre>

      <p>Furthermore:</p>
      <pre>
Where one will speak and one will heed
    What in the end is well,
Although unpleasant at the time,
    There riches love to dwell.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
No king's retainer should devise
A fraud, for spies are kingly eyes:
Then bear with harsh as kind, O King;
The truth is seldom flattering.

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n117.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x121" src="hertel2/n117.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>Tried servants never should be left,                    
    And strangers taken;
A kingdom's health by no disease
    Is sooner shaken.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“My good fellow,” said the lion, “pray do not say such
      things. For</p>
      <pre>
Never publicly defame
Any once commended name:
Broken promises are shame.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Now I formerly gave him a safe-conduct, since he appeared
      as a suppliant. How then can he prove ungrateful?” But Victor
      rejoined:</p>
      <pre>
“No rogue asks reason for his wrath;
Nor saint, to tread in kindness' path:
By nature's power, the sweet or sour
In sugar dwells or nim-tree's flower.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
Caress a rascal as you will,
He was and is a rascal still:
All salve- and sweating-treatments fail
To take the kink from doggy's tail.
</pre>

      <p>And once again:</p>
      <pre>
Slight kindness shown to lofty souls
A strange enlargement seeks:
The moonbeams gleam with whiter light
On Himalaya's peaks.
</pre>

      <p>While, on the other hand:</p>
      <pre>
The kindness shown to vicious souls
    Strange diminution seeks:
The gleam of moonbeams is absorbed
    On Sooty Mountain's peaks.

A hundred benefits are lost,
    If lavished on the mean;
A hundred epigrams, with their
    True relevance unseen;

A hundred counsels, when a life
    Obeys no rigid rule;
A hundred cogent arguments
    Are lost upon a fool.

Lost is every gift that goes
    Where it does not fit;
Lost is service lavished on
    Sluggish mind and wit;

Lost upon ingratitude
    Is the kindest plan;
Lost is courtesy on one
    Not a gentleman,
</pre>

      <p>Or put it this way:</p>
      <pre>
Perfume offered to a corpse,
    Lotus-planting dry,
Weeping in the wood, prolonged
    Rain on alkali,
Taking kinks from doggy's tail,
    Drawl in deafened ear,
Decking faces of the blind,
    Sense for fools to hear.
</pre>

      <p>Or this way:</p>
      <pre>
Milk a bull, and think him some
    Heavy-uddered cow;
Blind to lovely maidens, clasp
    Eunuchs anyhow;
Seek in shining scraps of quartz
    Lapis lazuli:
Do not serve an addlepate,
    Bidding sense goodbye.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Ergo, the master must by no means fail to heed my sound
      advice. And one thing more:</p>
      <pre>
What tiger, monkey, snake advised,
    I did not do; and so
That dreadfully ungrateful man
    Has brought me very low.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“How was that?” asked Rusty. And Victor told the story

      <h2><a href="#TOC">The Ungrateful Man</a></h2>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n118.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x122" src="hertel2/n118.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>In a certain town lived a Brahman whose name  was
      Sacrifice. Every day his wife, chafing under their poverty,
      would say to him: “Come, Brahman! Lazybones! Stony-Heart!
      Don’t you see your babies starving, while you hang about,
      mooning? Go somewhere, no matter where, find some way, any
      way, to get food, and come back in a hurry.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>At last the Brahman, weary of this refrain, undertook a
      long journey, and in a few days entered a great forest. While
      wandering hungry in this forest, he began to hunt for water.
      And in a certain spot he came upon a well, overgrown with
      grass. When he looked in, he discovered a tiger, a monkey, a
      snake, and a man at the bottom. They also saw him.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then the tiger thought: “Here comes a man,” and he cried:
      “O noble soul, there is great virtue in saving life. Think of
      that, and pull me out, so that I may live in the company of
      beloved friends, wife, sons, and relatives.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Why,” said the Brahman, “the very sound of your name
      brings a shiver to every living thing. I cannot deny that I
      fear you.” But the tiger resumed:</p>
      <pre>
“To Brahman-slayer, impotent,
To drunkard, him on treason bent,
To sinner through prevarication,
The holy grant an expiation:
While for ingratitude alone
No expiation will atone.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>And he continued: “I bind myself by a triple oath that no
      danger threatens you from me. Have pity and pull me out.”
      Then the Brahman thought it through to this conclusion: “If
      disaster befalls in the saving of life, it is a disaster that
      spells salvation.” So he pulled the tiger out.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n119.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x123" src="hertel2/n119.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>Next the monkey said: “Holy sir, pull me out  too.”
      And the Brahman pulled him out too. Then the snake said:
      “Brahman, pull me out too.” But the Brahman answered: “One
      shudders at the mere sound of your name, how much more at
      touching you!” “But,” said the snake, “we are not free
      agents. We bite only under orders. I bind myself by a triple
      oath that you need have no fear of me.” After listening to
      this, the Brahman pulled him out too. Then the animals said:
      “The man down there is a shrine of every sin. Beware. Do not
      pull him out. Do not trust him.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Furthermore, the tiger said: “Do you see this mountain
      with many peaks? My cave is in a wooded ravine on the north
      slope. You must do me the favor of paying me a visit there
      some day, so that I may make return for your kindness. I
      should not like to drag the debt into the next life.” With
      these words he started for his cave.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then the monkey said: “My home is quite near the cave,
      beside the waterfall. Please pay me a visit there.” With this
      he departed.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then the snake said: “In any emergency, remember me.” And
      he went his way.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then the man in the well shouted time and again: “Brahman!
      Pull me out too!” At last the Brahman’s pity was awakened,
      and he pulled him out, thinking: “He is a man, like me.” And
      the man said: “I am a goldsmith, and live in Baroch. If you
      have any gold to be worked into shape, you must bring it to
      me.” With this he started for home.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then the Brahman continued his wanderings but found
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n120.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x124" src="hertel2/n120.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      nothing whatever. As he started for home, he  recalled
      the monkey’s invitation. So he paid a visit, found the monkey
      at home, and received fruits sweet as nectar, which put new
      life into him. Furthermore, the monkey said: “If you ever
      have use for fruit, pray come here at any time.” “You have
      done a friend’s full duty,” said the Brahman. “But please
      introduce me to the tiger.” So the monkey led the way and
      introduced him to the tiger.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now the tiger recognized him and, by way of returning his
      kindness, bestowed on him a necklace and other ornaments of
      wrought gold, saying: “A certain prince whose horse ran away
      with him came here alone, and when he was within range of a
      spring, I killed him. All this I took from his person and
      stored carefully for you. Pray accept it and go where you
      will.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So the Brahman took it, then recalled the goldsmith and
      visited him, thinking: “He will do me the favor of getting it
      sold.” Now the goldsmith welcomed him with respectful
      hospitality, offering water for the feet, an honorable gift,
      a seat, hard food and soft, drink, and other things, then
      said: “Command me, sir. What may I do for you?” And the
      Brahman said: “I have brought you gold. Please sell it.”
      “Show me the gold,” said the goldsmith, and the other did
      so.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now the goldsmith thought when he saw it: “I worked this
      gold for the prince.” And having made sure of the fact, he
      said: “Please stay right here, while I show it to somebody.”
      With this he went to court and showed it to the king. On
      seeing it, the king asked: “Where did you get this?” And the
      goldsmith replied: “In my house is a Brahman. He brought
      it.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Thereupon the king reflected: “Without question, that
      villain killed my son. I will show him what that costs.” And
      he issued orders to the police: “Have this Brahman scum
      fettered, and impale him tomorrow morning.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n121.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x125" src="hertel2/n121.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>When the Brahman was fettered, he remembered  the
      snake, who appeared at once and said: “What can I do to serve
      you?” “Free me from these fetters,” said the Brahman. And the
      snake replied: “I will bite the king’s dear queen. Then, in
      spite of the charms employed by any great conjurer and the
      antidotes of other physicians, I will keep her poisoned. Only
      by the touch of your hand will the poison be neutralized.
      Then you will go free.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Having made this promise, the snake bit the queen,
      whereupon shouts of despair arose in the palace, and the
      entire city was filled with dismay. Then they summoned
      dealers in antidotes, conjurers, scientists, druggists, and
      foreigners, all of whom treated the case with such resources
      as they had, but none could neutralize the poison. Finally, a
      proclamation was made with beat of drum, upon hearing which
      the Brahman said: “I will cure her.” The moment he spoke,
      they freed him from his fetters, took him to the king, and
      introduced him. And the king said: “Cure her, sir.” So he
      went to the queen and cured her by the mere touch of his
      hand.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When the king saw her restored to life, he paid the
      Brahman honor and reverence, then respectfully asked him:
      “Reveal the truth, sir. How did you come by this gold?” And
      the Brahman began at the beginning and related the whole
      adventure accurately. As soon as the king comprehended the
      facts, he arrested the goldsmith, while he gave the Brahman a
      thousand villages and appointed him privy counselor. But the
      Brahman summoned his family, was surrounded by friends and
      relatives, took delight in eating and other natural
      functions, acquired massive merit by the performance of
      numerous sacrifices, concentrated authority by heedful
      attention to all phases of royal duty, and lived happily.</p>

      <p>“O King, he is obviously a traitor. However,</p>
      <pre>
Tirelessly benevolent,
Save a friend on evil bent:
This is sainthood's perfect song;
Every substitute is wrong.

      <p>Again:</p>
      <pre>
Who saves from vice is truly kind;
True wife is she who shares your mind;
True acts are free from every blame;
True joy, from avarice's shame;
True wisdom wins the praise of saints;
True friends involve in no restraints;
True glory knows no haughtiness;
True men are cheerful in distress.

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
Rest your sleeping head in fire;
Pillow it with snakes:
Do not smile at worthy friends
Who pursue mistakes.

      <p>“Now my lord and king associates with Lively, making a
      vicious mistake that results in the neglect of the three
      things worth living for—virtue, money, and love. And in spite
      of my protestations, urged from various points of view, my
      lord and king goes his wilful way, unheeding. In the future,
      therefore, when the crash comes, do not blame your servant.
      You have heard the saying:</p>
      <pre>
No thought of profit or of right
    Can headstrong monarchs stay,
Who, like bull-elephants amuck,
    Pursue their reckless way;
When, puffed with pride, they come to grief
    In thickets of distress,
They blame their servants, and forget
    Their proper naughtiness.”

      <p>“Such being the case, my good fellow,” said the lion,
      “should I warn him?” “What! Warn him?” said Victor. “ What
      kind of policy would that be? For</p>

He stings or strikes in hasty fear
    When warning has been heard:
'Tis wise to warn an enemy
    By action, not by word.”

      <p>“After all,” said Rusty, “he is a grass-nibbler. I am a
      carnivore. How can he hurt me?” “Precisely,” said Victor. “He
      is a grass-nibbler. My lord and king is a carnivore. He is
      food. My lord and king devours food. In spite of all, if the
      fellow is not likely to work harm through his own power, he
      will egg on another to it. As the saying goes:</p>

The weak, malicious fool
Can use a keener tool:
It sharpens sword-blades, but
The whetstone cannot cut.”

      answered: “Why, you have constantly engaged in battle with
      unnumbered bull-elephants, wild oxen, buffaloes, boars,
      tigers, and leopards, until your body is spotted with scars
      left by the thrust of claw and tusk. Now this Lively, living
      beside you, is always scattering his excrement far and wide.
      In it worms will breed. These worms, finding your body
      conveniently near, will creep into ready-made crevices, and
      will bore deep. And so you are as good as dead. As the
      proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
With no stranger share your house;
Leap, the flea, killed Creep, the louse.”

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“How was that?” asked Rusty. And Victor told the story

      <h2><a href="#TOC">Leap and Creep</a></h2>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>In the palace of a certain king stood an incomparable bed,
      blessed with every cubiculary virtue. In a corner of its
      coverlet lived a female louse named Creep. Surrounded by a
      thriving family of sons and daughters, with the sons and
      daughters of sons and daughters, and with more remote
      descendants, she drank the king’s blood as he slept. On this
      diet she grew plump and handsome.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>While she was living there in this manner, a flea named
      Leap drifted in on the wind and dropped on the bed. This flea
      felt supreme satisfaction on examining the bed—the wonderful
      delicacy of its coverlet, its double pillow, its exceptional
      softness like that of a broad, Gangetic sand-bank, its
      delicious perfume. Charmed by the sheer delight of touching
      it, he hopped this way and that until—fate willed it so—he
      chanced to meet Creep, who said to him: “Where do you come
      from? This is a dwelling fit for a king. Begone, and lose no
      time about it.” “Madam,” said he, “you should not say such
      things. For</p>
      <pre>
The Brahman reverences fire,
Himself the lower castes' desire;
The wife reveres her husband dear;
But all the world must guests revere.
</pre>

      <p>Now I am your guest. I have of late sampled the various
      blood of Brahmans, warriors, business men, and serfs, but
      found it acid, slimy, quite unwholesome. On the contrary, he
      who reposes on this bed must have a delightful vital fluid,
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n124.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x128" src="hertel2/n124.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      just like nectar. It must  be free from morbidity, since
      wind, bile, and phlegm are kept in harmony by constant and
      heedful use of potions prepared by physicians. It must be
      enriched by viands unctuous, tender, melting in the mouth;
      viands prepared from the flesh of the choicest creatures of
      land, water, and air, seasoned furthermore with sugar,
      pomegranate, ginger, and pepper. To me it seems an elixir of
      life. Therefore, with your kind permission, I plan to taste
      this sweet and fragrant substance, thus combining pleasure
      and profit.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“No,” said she. “For fiery-mouthed stingers like you, it
      is out of the question. Leave this bed. You know the
      proverb:</p>
      <pre>
The fool who does not know
His own resource, his foe,
His duty, time, and place,
Who sets a reckless pace,
Will by the wayside fall,
Will reap no fruit at all.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Thereupon he fell at her feet, repeating his request. And
      she agreed, since courtesy was her hobby, and since, when the
      story of that prince of sharpers, Muladeva, was being
      repeated to the king while she lay on a corner of the
      coverlet, she had heard how Muladeva quoted this verse in
      answer to the question of a certain damsel:</p>
      <pre>
Whoever, angry though he be,
Has spurned a suppliant enemy,
In Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma, he
Has scorned the Holy Trinity.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Recalling this, she agreed, but added: “However, you must
      not come to dinner at a wrong place or time.” “What is the
      right place and what is the right time?” he asked. “Being a
      newcomer, I am not <em>au</em> <em>courant</em>.” And she
      replied: “When the king’s body is mastered by wine, fatigue,
      or sleep, then you may quietly bite him on the feet. This is
      the right place and the right time.” To these conditions he
      gave his assent.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>In spite of this arrangement, the famished bungler, when
      the king had just dozed off in the early evening, bit him on
      the back. And the poor king, as if burned by a firebrand, as
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n125.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x129" src="hertel2/n125.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      if stung by a scorpion,  as if touched by a torch,
      bounded to his feet, scratched his back, and cried to a
      servant: “Rascal! Somebody bit me. You must hunt through this
      bed until you find the insect.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now Leap heard the king’s command and in terrified haste
      crept into a crevice in the bed. Then the king’s servants
      entered, and following their master’s orders, brought a lamp
      and made a minute inspection. As fate would have it, they
      came upon Creep as she crouched in the nap of the fabric, and
      killed her with her family.</p>

      <h2><a href="#TOC">The Blue Jackal</a></h2>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>There was once a jackal named Fierce-Howl, who lived in a
      cave near the suburbs of a city. One day he was hunting for
      food, his throat pinched with hunger, and wandered into the
      city after nightfall. There the city dogs snapped at his
      limbs with their sharp-pointed teeth, and terrified his heart
      with their dreadful barking, so that he stumbled this way and
      that in his efforts to escape and happened into the house of
      a dyer. There he tumbled into a tremendous indigo vat, and
      all the dogs went home.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Presently the jackal—further life being
      predestined—managed to crawl out of the indigo vat and
      escaped into the forest. There all the thronging animals in
      his vicinity caught a glimpse of his body dyed with the juice
      of indigo, and crying out: “What is this creature enriched
      with that unprecedented color?” they fled, their eyes dancing
      with terror, and spread the report: “Oh, oh! Here is an
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n126.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x130" src="hertel2/n126.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      exotic creature that has dropped from somewhere. Nobody 
      knows what his conduct might be, or his energy. We are going
      to vamoose. For the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
Where you do not know
    Conduct, stock, and pluck,
'Tis not wise to trust,
    If you wish for luck.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now Fierce-Howl perceived their dismay, and called to
      them: “Come, come, you wild things! Why do you flee in terror
      at sight of me? For Indra, realizing that the forest
      creatures have no monarch, anointed me—my name is
      Fierce-Howl—as your king. Rest in safety within the cage
      formed by my resistless paws.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>On hearing this, the lions, tigers, leopards, monkeys,
      rabbits, gazelles, jackals, and other species of wild life
      bowed humbly, saying: “Master, prescribe to us our duties.”
      Thereupon he appointed the lion prime minister and the tiger
      lord of the bedchamber, while the leopard was made custodian
      of the king’s betel, the elephant doorkeeper, and the monkey
      the bearer of the royal parasol. But to all the jackals, his
      own kindred, he administered a cuffing, and drove them away.
      Thus he enjoyed the kingly glory, while lions and others
      killed food-animals and laid them before him. These he
      divided and distributed to all after the manner of kings.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>While time passed in this fashion, he was sitting one day
      in his court when he heard the sound made by a pack of
      jackals howling near by. At this his body thrilled, his eyes
      filled with tears of joy, he leaped to his feet, and began to
      howl in a piercing tone. When the lions and others heard
      this, they perceived that he was a jackal, and stood for a
      moment shamefaced and downcast, then they said: “Look! We
      have been deceived by this jackal. Let the fellow be killed.”
      And when he heard this, he endeavored to flee, but was torn
      to bits by a tiger and died.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then Rusty asked: “How am I to recognize that he is
      treacherous? And what is his fighting technique?” And Victor
      answered: “Formerly he would come into the presence of my
      lord and king with limbs relaxed. If today he approaches
      timidly, in obvious readiness to thrust with his horns, then
      the king may understand that he has treachery in mind.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Hereupon Victor rose and visited Lively. To him, also, he
      showed himself sluggish, like one penetrated by
      discouragement. Therefore Lively said: “My good fellow, are
      you in spirits?” To which he replied: “How can a dependent be
      in spirits? For you know</p>
      <pre>
They see their wealth in others' power
    Who wait upon a king;
They even fear to lose their lives:
    A doleful song they sing.
</pre>

      <p>Again:</p>
      <pre>
With birth begin the sorrows which
    Forever after cling,
The never ending train of woes
    In service of a king.

Five deaths-in-life sage Vyasa notes
    With well-known epic swing:
The poor man, sick man, exile, fool,
    And servant of a king.

His food repels; he dare not say
    An independent thing;
Though sleepless, he is not awake
    Who hangs upon a king.

The common phrase ‘a dog's life’ has
    A most persuasive ring:
But dogs can do the things they like;
    A slave obeys his king.

He must be chaste, sleep hard, grow thin,
    And eat a meager dinner:
The servant lives as lives the saint,
    Yet is not saint, but sinner.

He cannot do the things he would;
    He serves another's mind;
He sells his body. How can such
    A wretch contentment find?

According to the lesser distance,
A servant uses more persistence
In watching for his master's whim
And trembling at the sight of him:
And this because a fire, a king,
Are double name for single thing,
A burning thing that men can stand
Afar, but not too close at hand.

What flavor has a tidbit, though
    It be as good as good,
Soft, dainty, melting in the mouth,
    If bought by servitude?
</pre>

      <p>To sum it all up:</p>
      <pre>
What is my place? My time? My friends?
Expenditure or dividends?
And what am I? And what my power?
So must one ponder hour by hour.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>After listening to this, Lively said, perceiving that
      Victor had a hidden purpose in mind: “Tell me, my good
      fellow, what you wish to imply.” And Victor answered: “Well,
      you are my friend. I cannot help telling you what is to your
      profit. Here goes. The master, Rusty, is filled with wrath
      against you. And he said today: ‘I will kill Lively and
      provide a feast for all who eat meat.’ Of course, I fell into
      deep dejection on hearing this. Now you must do what the
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n128.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x132" src="hertel2/n128.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>       crisis demands.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>To Lively this report was like the fall of a thunderbolt,
      and he fell into deep dejection. Yet as Victor’s words were
      always plausible, he grew more and more troubled, fell into a
      panic, and said: “Yes, the proverb is right:</p>
      <pre>
Women oft are tricked by scamps;
    Kings with rascals oft agree;
Toward the skinflints money drifts;
    Rain on mountains falls and sea.
</pre>

      <p>Ah, me! Ah, me! What is this that has befallen me?</p>
      <pre>
You serve your king most heedfully.
    Of course. Who could complain?
But enmity as your reward
    Is unexpected pain.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
If one is angry, giving cause,
Remove it, and the wrath will pause:
But how may man propitiate
A mind that harbors causeless hate?

Who does not fear the scoundrel's art,
The causeless hate, the flinty heart?
For ever ready venom drips
Resistless from his serpent-lips.

The stupid king-swan pecks by night
At starshine, in the water bright
Believing it a lotus white;

Then, fearing stars when shines the sun,
Avoids the lotus. Everyone
Who dreads a trap, will blessings shun.
</pre>

      <p>Alas! What wrong have I done our master Rusty?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Comrade,” said Victor, “kings love to injure without
      reason, and they seek out the vulnerable spot in an
      adversary.” “True, too true,” said Lively. “There is wisdom
      in the verse:</p>
      <pre>
The serpent sandal-trees defiles;
In lotus-ponds lurk crocodiles;
The slanderer makes virtue vain:
No blessing lacks attendant pain.

No lotus decks the mountain height;
From scoundrels issues nothing right;
To saints no change of heart is known;
Rice never sprouts from barley sown.

Nobility's constraints
Are felt by gracious saints,
Who bear good deeds in mind
Forget the other kind.

      <h2><a href="#TOC">Passion and the Owl</a></h2>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Within a certain forest was a broad expanse of lake. There
      lived a king-swan named Passion, who spent his days in a
      great variety of pastimes. One day death, fatal death,
      visited him in the person of an owl. And the swan said: “This
      is a lonely wood. Where do you come from?” The owl replied:
      “I came because I heard of your virtues. Furthermore,</p>
      <pre>
In search of virtue roaming
    The wide world through,
No virtues being greater,
    I come to you.

That I must cling in friendship
    To you, is sure:
The impure turns, attaining
    The Ganges, pure.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
The conch was bone that Vishnu's hand
    Has purified:
For contact with the righteous lends
    A noble pride.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>After this address, the swan gave his assent, in the
      words: “My excellent friend, dwell with me as you like by
      this broad lake in this pleasant wood.” So their time was
      spent in friendly diversions.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>But one day the owl said: “I am going to my own home,
      which is called Lotus Grove. If you set any value on me and
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n130.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x134" src="hertel2/n130.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      feel any affection, you must not fail  to pay a visit as
      my guest.” With these words he went home.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now as time passed, the swan reflected: “I have grown old,
      living in this spot, and I do not know a single other region.
      So now I will go to visit my dear friend, the owl. There I
      shall find a brand-new recreation ground and new kinds of
      food, both hard and soft.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>After these reflections, he went to visit the owl. At
      first he could not find him in Lotus Grove, and when, after a
      minute search, he discovered him, there was the poor creature
      crouching in an ugly hole, for he was blind in the daytime.
      But Passion called: “My dear fellow, come out! I am your dear
      friend the swan, come to pay you a visit.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>And the owl replied: “I do not stir by day. You and I will
      meet when the sun has set.” So the swan waited a long time,
      met the owl at night, and after giving the conventional
      information about his health, being wearied by his journey,
      he went to sleep on the spot.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now it happened that a large commercial caravan had
      encamped at that very lake. At dawn the leader rose and had
      the signal of departure given by conch. This the owl answered
      with a loud, harsh hoot, then dived into a hole in the
      river-bank. But the swan did not stir. Now the evil omen so
      disturbed the leader’s spirit that he gave orders to a
      certain archer who could aim by sound. This archer strung his
      powerful bow, drew an arrow as far as his ear, and killed the
      swan, who was resting near the owl’s nest.</p>

      at first, but at the last his purpose turns to poison. Ah,
      yes!</p>
      <pre>
He compliments you to your face;

Thence, in its middle journey, shoot
Gay flowers of speech that fail to fruit;
Its final goal is treason, shame,
Disgust, and slanders that defame:
Alas! Who made the cursèd thing?
Its one foul purpose is to sting.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
They bow abjectly; leap to greet
You with their speech seductive-sweet;
Pursue and hug you day by day;
Of deep devotion make display:
All praise your virtue. Never one
Finds time to do what should be done.

      <p>“Woe is me! How can I, a creature herbivorous, consort
      with this lion who devours raw flesh? There is wisdom in the
      saying:</p>
      <pre>
Where wealth is very much the same,
And similar the family fame,
Marriage or friendship is secure;
But not between the rich and poor.
</pre>

      <p>And there is a proverb:</p>
      <pre>
The sun, already setting, shows
    His final flaming power,
And still the honey-thirsty bee
    Explores the lotus-flower,
Forgets that it will prove a trap
    That shuts at set of sun:
Ambition, thirsting for reward,
    Is blind to dangers run.

Abandoning the lotus-bloom
    With all its sweet content,
The jasmine's natural perfume
    And luxury of scent,
The water-bees seek toilsome food,
    On ichor-sipping bent:
So men reject the easy good,
    In rogues o'erconfident.

The bees that, too adventurous,
    A novel honey seek
In springtime ichor glistening on
    The elephant-monarch's cheek,
When, tossed by wind from flapping ears,
    They tumble to the ground,
Remember then what gentle sport
    In lotus-cups is found.

      For</p>
      <pre>
The fruit-tree's branch by very wealth
    Of fruit is bended low;
The peacock's feathered pride compels
    A sluggish gait and slow;
The blooded horse that wins his race,
    Must like a cow be led:
The good in goodness often find
    An enemy to dread.

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n132.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x136" src="hertel2/n132.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>Where Jumna's waves roll blue                           
With sands of sapphire hue,
Black serpents have their lair;
And who would hunt them there,
But that a jewel's bright star
From each hood gleams afar?
By virtue rising, all
By that same virtue fall.

The man of virtue commonly
    Is hateful to the king,
While riches to the scamps and fools
    Habitually cling:
The ancient chant ‘By virtue great
    Is man’ has run to seed;
The world takes rare and little note
    Of any plucky deed.

Sad, shamefaced lions fail to rage,
Their spirit mastered by the cage;
And captive elephants' brows and pride
By drivers' goads are scarified;
Charms dull the cobras; hopeless woe
Lays scholars flat and soldiers low:
For Time, the mountebank, enjoys
A juggling bout with chosen toys.

The honey-greedy bee&mdash;poor fool!&mdash;
Deserts the flowering lotus-pool
Where danger is not found, to sip
The springtime ichor-rills that drip
From elephant foreheads; does not fear
The flapping of that monstrous ear:
So, by his nature, greedy man
Forgets the issue of his plan.

      <p>“How was that?” asked Victor. And Lively told the story
      of</p>

    <div id="uglys-trust-abused">
      <h2><a href="#TOC">Ugly’s Trust Abused</a></h2>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>In a certain city lived a merchant named Ocean, who loaded
      a hundred camels with valuable cloth and set out in a certain
      direction. Now one of his camels, whose name was Ugly, was
      overburdened and fell limp, with every limb relaxed. Then the
      merchant divided the pack of cloth, loaded it on other
      camels, and because he found himself in a wild forest region
      where delay was impossible, he proceeded, leaving Ugly
      behind.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When the trader was gone, Ugly hobbled about and began to
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n133.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x137" src="hertel2/n133.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      crop the grass. Thus in a very few days  the poor fellow
      regained his strength.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>In that forest lived a lion whose name was Haughty, who
      had as hangers-on a leopard, a crow, and a jackal. As they
      roamed the forest, they encountered the abandoned camel, and
      the lion said, after observing his fantastic and comical
      shape: “This is an exotic in our forest. Ask him what he is.”
      So the crow informed himself of the facts and said: “This is
      what goes by the name of camel in the world.” Thereupon the
      lion asked him: “My good friend, where did you come from?”
      And the camel gave precise details of his separation from the
      trader, so that the lion experienced compassion and
      guaranteed his personal security.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>In this posture of affairs, the lion fought an elephant
      one day, received a thrust from a tusk, and had to keep his
      cave. And when five or six days had passed, they all found
      themselves in urgent distress from the failure of food. So
      the lion, observing how they drooped, said to them: “I am
      crippled by this wound and cannot supply you with the usual
      food. You will just have to make an effort on your own
      account.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>And they replied: “Why should we care to thrive, while our
      lord and king is in this state?” “Bravo!” said the lion. “You
      show the conduct and devotion of good servants. Round up some
      food-animal for me while I am in this condition.” Then, when
      they made no answer, he said to them: “Come! Do not be
      bashful. Hunt up some creature. Even in my present condition
      I will convert it into food for you and myself.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So the four started to roam the woods. Since they found no
      food-animal, the crow and the jackal conferred together, and
      the jackal said: “Friend crow, why roam about? Here is Ugly,
      who trusts our king. Let us provide for our sustenance by
      killing him.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n134.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x138" src="hertel2/n134.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>“A very good suggestion,” said the crow. “But  after
      all, the master guaranteed his personal security, and so
      cannot kill him.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Quite so,” said the jackal. “I will interview the master
      and make him think of killing Ugly. Stay right here until I
      go home and return with the master’s answer.” With this he
      hastened to the master.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When he found the lion, he said: “Master, we have roamed
      the entire forest, and are now too famished to stir a foot.
      Besides, the king is on a diet. So, if the king commands, one
      might fortify one’s health today by means of Ugly’s
      flesh.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When the lion had listened to this ruthless proposal, he
      cried out angrily: “Shame upon you, most degraded of sinners!
      The moment you repeat those words, I will strike you dead.
      Why, I guaranteed his personal security. How can I kill him
      with my own paw? You have heard the saying:</p>
      <pre>
The wise declare and understand
No gift of cow or food or land
To be among all gifts as grand
As safety granted on demand.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Master,” replied the jackal, “if you kill him after
      guaranteeing his safety, then you are indeed blameworthy. If,
      however, of his own accord he devotedly offers his own life
      to his lord and king, then no blame attaches. So you may kill
      him on condition that he voluntarily destines himself to
      slaughter. Otherwise, pray eat one or another of the rest of
      us. For the king is on a diet, and if food fails, he will
      experience a change for the worse. In that case, what value
      have these lives of ours, which will no longer be spent in
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n135.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x139" src="hertel2/n135.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      our master’s service? If anything disagreeable happens 
      to our gracious master, then we must follow him into the
      fire. For the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
Save the chieftain of the clan,
    Whatsoe'er the pain;
Lose him, and the clan is lost:
    Hubless spokes are vain.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>After listening to this, Haughty said: “Very well. Do as
      you will.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>With this message the jackal hastened to say to the
      others: “Well, friends, the master is very low. The life is
      oozing from the tip of his nose. If he goes, who will be our
      protector in this forest? So, since starvation is driving him
      toward the other world, let us go and voluntarily offer our
      own bodies. Thus we shall pay the debt we owe our gracious
      master. And the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
Servants, when disaster
Comes upon their master,
If alive and well,
Tread the road to hell.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So they all went, their eyes brimming with tears, bowed
      low before Haughty, and sat down.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>On seeing them, Haughty said: “My friends, did you catch
      any creature, or see any?” And the crow replied: “Master,
      though we roamed everywhere, we still did not catch any
      creature, nor see any. Master, pray eat me and support your
      life for a day. Thus the master will be replete, while I
      shall rise to heaven. For the saying goes:</p>
      <pre>
A servant who, in loyal love,
Has yielded up his breath,
Adorns a lofty seat in heaven,
Secure from age and death.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>On hearing this, the jackal said: “Your body is small. If
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n136.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x140" src="hertel2/n136.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      he ate you, the master would scarcely prolong  his life.
      Besides, there is a moral objection. For the verse tells
      us:</p>
      <pre>
Crows' flesh and such small leavings
    Are things to be passed by:
Why eat an evil somewhat
    That does not satisfy?
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“You have shown your loyalty, and have won a saintly
      reputation in both worlds. Now make way, while I address the
      master.” So the jackal bowed respectfully and said: “Master,
      pray use my body to support your life today, thus conferring
      on me the best of earth and heaven. For the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
Since servants' lives on masters hang
    In forfeit for their pay,
The master perpetrates no sin
    In taking them away.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Hearing this, the leopard said: “Very praiseworthy,
      indeed, my friend. However, your body is rather small, too.
      Besides, he ought not to eat you, since you belong to the
      same unguipugnacious family. You know the proverb:</p>
      <pre>
The prudent, though with life at stake,
    Avoid forbidden food
(Too small at that)&mdash;from fear to lose
    Both earth's and heaven's good.
</pre>

      <p>Well, you have shown yourself a loyal servant. There is
      truth in the stanza:</p>
      <pre>
That swarms of gentlemen delight
    A monarch, is not strange,
Since, first and last and times between,
    Their honor does not change.
</pre>

      <p>Make way, then, so that I, too, may win the master’s
      grace.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Thereupon the leopard bowed low and said: “Master, pray
      prolong your life for a day at the cost of my life. Grant me
      an everlasting home in heaven, and spread my fame afar on
      earth. Pray show no hesitation. For the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
A servant who, by loyal love,
    Has demonstrated worth,
Attains a lasting home above
    And glory on the earth.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n137.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x141" src="hertel2/n137.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>Hearing this, poor Ugly thought: “Well, they  used
      the most elegant phrases. Yet the master did not kill a
      single one of them. So I, too, will make a speech befitting
      the occasion. I have no doubt that all three will contradict
      me.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Having come to this conclusion, he said: “Very admirable,
      friend leopard. But you too are unguipugnacious. How, then,
      can the master eat you? There is a proverb to fit the
      case:</p>
      <pre>
The mere imagining of wrongs
    To kinsmen done, confirms
The loss of earth and heaven. Such rogues
    Turn into unclean worms.
</pre>

      <p>Make way then, so that I, too, may address the
      master.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So poor Ugly stood in the presence, bowed low and said:
      “Master, these you surely may not eat. Pray prolong your life
      by means of my life, so that I may win the best of earth and
      heaven. For the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
No sacrificer and no saint
    Can ever rise as high
As do the simple servingfolk
    Who for the master die.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Hereupon the lion gave the word, the leopard and the
      jackal tore his body, the crow pecked out his eyes, poor Ugly
      yielded up the ghost, and all the others ravenously devoured
      him.</p>

      <p>After telling the story, Lively continued, addressing
      Victor: “My dear fellow, this king, with his shabby advisers,

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n138.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x142" src="hertel2/n138.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>In a certain city lived a carpenter named Trust-god. 
      It was his constant habit to carry his lunch and go with his
      wife into the forest, where he cut great anjana logs. Now in
      that forest lived a lion named Spotless, who had as
      hangers-on two carnivorous creatures, a jackal and a
      crow.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>One day the lion was roaming the wood alone and
      encountered the carpenter. The carpenter for his part, on
      beholding that most alarming lion, whether considering
      himself already lost or perhaps with the ready wit to
      perceive that it is safer to face the powerful, advanced to
      meet the lion, bowed low, and said: “Come, friend, come!
      Today you must eat my own dinner which my wife—your brother’s
      wife—has provided.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“My good fellow,” said the lion, “being carnivorous, I do
      not live on rice. But in spite of that, I will have a taste,
      since I take a fancy to you. What kind of dainty have you
      got?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When the lion had spoken, the carpenter stuffed him with
      all kinds of dainties—buns, muffins, chewers, and things, all
      flavored with sugar, butter, grapejuice, and spice. And to
      show his gratitude, the lion guaranteed his safety and
      granted unhindered passage through the forest. Then the
      carpenter said: “Comrade, you must come here every day, but
      please come alone. You must not bring anyone else to visit
      me.” In this manner they spent their days in friendship. And
      the lion, since every day he received such hospitality, such
      a variety of goodies, gave up the practice of hunting.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then the jackal and the crow, who lived on others’ luck,
      went hungry, and they implored the lion. “Master,” they said,
      “where do you go every day? And tell us why you come back so
      happy.” “I don’t go anywhere,” said he. But when they urged
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n139.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x143" src="hertel2/n139.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      the  question with great deference, the lion said: “A
      friend of mine comes into this wood every day. His wife cooks
      the most delicious things, and I eat them every day, in order
      to show friendly feeling.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then the jackal and the crow said: “We two will go there,
      will kill the carpenter, and have enough meat and blood to
      keep us fat for a long time.” But the lion heard them and
      said: “Look here! I guaranteed his safety. How can I even
      imagine playing him such a scurvy trick? But I will get a
      delicious tidbit from him for you also.” To this they
      agreed.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So the three started to find the carpenter. While they
      were still far off, the carpenter caught a glimpse of the
      lion and his seedy companions, and he thought: “This does not
      look prosperous to me.” So he and his wife made haste to
      climb a tree.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then the lion came up and said: “My good fellow, why did
      you climb a tree when you saw me? Why, I am your friend, the
      lion. My name is Spotless. Do not be alarmed.” But the
      carpenter stayed where he was and said:</p>
      <pre>
Your jackal does not reassure;
    Your crow's sharp bill offends:
You therefore see me up a tree&mdash;
    I do not like your friends.

      have set Rusty against me. Besides:</p>

Soft water's scars elide

      <p>“Under these circumstances, what action is opportune?
      Indeed, there is nothing left save battle. For the proverb
      says:</p>
      <pre>
By gifts, by self-denial,
By sacrificial trial,
    Some slowly win to heaven;
To him who yields his life

    Quick entrance there is given.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
The slain attains the sky,
    The victor joyful lives;
And heroes are content
    With these alternatives.

And sign of monarchs&mdash;shun the coward,
    Are not for mamma's boy.”

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When he heard this, Victor thought: “The fellow has sharp
      horns and plenty of vigor. He might perhaps strike down the
      master, if fate decreed it. That would not do, either. And
      the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
Even with heroes victory
    Whimsically may alight.
Try three other methods first;
    Only <i>in extremis</i> fight.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So I will use my wits to turn his thoughts from fighting.”
      And he said: “My dear fellow, this is not a good plan,
      because</p>
      <pre>
He loses fights who fights before
    His foeman's power is reckoned:
The ocean and the plover fought,

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>In due time she became pregnant and was ready to lay her
      eggs. So she said to her husband: “Please find a spot where I
      may lay my eggs.” “Why,” said he, “this home of ours,
      inherited from our ancestors, promises progress. Lay your
      eggs here.” “Oh,” said she, “don’t mention this dreadful
      place. Here is the ocean near at hand. His tide might some
      day make a long reach and lick away my babies.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>But the plover answered: “Sweetheart, he knows me, he
      knows Sprawl. Surely the great ocean cannot show such enmity
      to me. Did you never hear this?</p>
      <pre>
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n141.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x145" src="hertel2/n141.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>What man is rash enough to take                         
The gleaming crest-jewel from a snake?
Or stirs the wrath of one so dread
His glance may strike his victim dead?

However summer heat distresses
In wild and treeless wildernesses,
Who, after all, would seek the shade
By some rogue elephant's body made?
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
When morning's chilly breezes blow
With whirling particles of snow,
What man with sense of value sure,
Employs for cold the water cure?

To visit Death what man desires,
So wakes the lion's sleeping fires,
Who, tired from slaying elephants,
Lies in a temporary trance?

Who dares to visit and defy
The death-god? Dares the fearless cry&mdash;
I challenge you to single strife;
If power be yours, pray take my life?

What son of man, with simple wit,
Defies the fire, and enters it&mdash;
The smokeless flame that terrifies,
Whose tongues by hundreds lick the skies?”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>But even as he spoke, his wife laughed outright, since she
      knew the full measure of his capacity, and she said: “Very
      fine, indeed. There is plenty more where that came from. O
      king of birds,</p>
      <pre>
Your heavy boastings startle, shock,
And make of you a laughingstock:
One marvels if the rabbit plants
A dung-pile like the elephant's.

      <p>How can you fail to appreciate your own strength and
      weakness? There is a saying:</p>
      <pre>
To know one's self is hard, to know
Wise effort, effort vain;
But accurate self-critics are
Secure in times of strain.

This much of effort brings success;
I have the power; I can:
So think, then act, and reap the fruit
Of your judicious plan.

Be ever satisfied:
The stupid turtle lost his grip

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“How was that?” asked Sprawl. And Constance told the story
      of</p>

      <h2><a href="#TOC">Shell-Neck, Slim, and Grim</a></h2>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>In a certain lake lived a turtle named Shell-Neck. He had
      as friends two ganders whose names were Slim and Grim. Now in
      the vicissitudes of time there came a twelve-year drought,
      which begot ideas of this nature in the two ganders: “This
      lake has gone dry. Let us seek another body of water.
      However, we must first say farewell to Shell-Neck, our dear
      and long-proved friend.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When they did so, the turtle said: “Why do you bid me
      farewell? I am a water-dweller, and here I should perish very
      quickly from the scant supply of water and from grief at loss
      of you. Therefore, if you feel any affection for me, please
      rescue me from the jaws of this death. Besides, as the water
      dries in this lake, you two suffer nothing beyond a
      restricted diet, while to me it means immediate death.
      Consider which is more serious, loss of food or loss of
      life.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>But they replied: “We are unable to take you with us since
      you are a water-creature without wings.” Yet the turtle
      continued: “There is a possible device. Bring a stick of
      wood.” This they did, whereupon the turtle gripped the middle
      of the stick between his teeth, and said: “Now take firm hold
      with your bills, one on each side, fly up, and travel with
      even flight through the sky, until we discover another
      desirable body of water.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>But they objected: “There is a hitch in this fine plan. If
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n143.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x147" src="hertel2/n143.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      you happen to indulge in the smallest  conversation,
      then you will lose your hold on the stick, will fall from a
      great height, and will be dashed to bits.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Oh,” said the turtle, “from this moment I take a vow of
      silence, to last as long as we are in heaven.” So they
      carried out the plan, but while the two ganders were
      painfully carrying the turtle over a neighboring city, the
      people below noticed the spectacle, and there arose a
      confused buzz of talk as they asked: “What is this cartlike
      object that two birds are carrying through the
      atmosphere?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Hearing this, the doomed turtle was heedless enough to
      ask: “What are these people chattering about?” The moment he
      spoke, the poor simpleton lost his grip and fell to the
      ground. And persons who wanted meat cut him to bits in a
      moment with sharp knives.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“And that is why I say:</p>
      <pre>
To take advice from kindly friends, ....
</pre>

      <p>and the rest of it.” And Constance continued:</p>
      <pre>
Forethought and Ready wit thrive;
Fatalist can't keep alive.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“How was that?” asked Sprawl. And she told the story

      <h2><a href="#TOC">Forethought, Readywit, and
      Fatalist</a></h2>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>In a great lake lived three full-grown fishes, whose names
      were Forethought, Readywit, and Fatalist. Now one day the
      fish named Forethought overheard passers-by on the bank and
      fishermen saying: “There are plenty of fish in this pond.
      Tomorrow we go fishing.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>On hearing this, Forethought reflected: “This looks bad.
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n144.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x148" src="hertel2/n144.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      Tomorrow or the day after they will be  sure to come
      here. I will take Readywit and Fatalist and move to another
      lake whose waters are not troubled.” So he called them and
      put the question.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Thereupon Readywit said: “I have lived long in this lake
      and cannot move in such a hurry. If fishermen come here, then
      I will protect myself by some means devised for the
      occasion.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>But poor, doomed Fatalist said: “There are sizable lakes
      elsewhere. Who knows whether they will come here or not? One
      should not abandon the lake of his birth merely because of
      such small gossip. And the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
Since scamp and sneak and snake
So often undertake
A plan that does not thrive,
The world wags on, alive.
</pre>

      <p>Therefore I am determined not to go.” And when Forethought
      realized that their minds were made up, he went to another
      body of water.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>On the next day, when he had gone, the fishermen with
      their boys beset the inner pool, cast a net, and caught all
      the fish without exception. Under these circumstances
      Readywit, while still in the water, played dead. And since
      they thought: “This big fellow died without help,” they drew
      him from the net and laid him on the bank, from which he
      wriggled back to safety in the water. But Fatalist stuck his
      nose into the meshes of the net, struggling until they
      pounded him repeatedly with clubs and so killed him.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“And that is why I say:</p>
      <pre>
Forethought and Readywit thrive;
Fatalist can't keep alive.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“My dear,” said the plover, “why do you think me like
      Fatalist?</p>
      <pre>
Horses, elephants, and iron,
Water, woman, man,
Sticks and stones and clothes are built
On a different plan.
</pre>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n145.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x149" src="hertel2/n145.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>Feel no anxiety. Who can bring humiliation upon  you
      while my arms protect you?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So Constance laid her eggs, but the ocean, who had
      listened to the previous conversation, thought: “Well, well!
      There is sense in the saying:</p>
      <pre>
Of self-conceit all creatures show
    An adequate supply:
The plover lies with claws upstretched
    To prop the falling sky.
</pre>

      <p>I will just put his power to the test.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So the next day, when the two plovers had gone foraging,
      he made a long reach with his wave-hands and eagerly seized
      the eggs. Then when the hen-plover returned and found the
      nursery empty, she said to her husband: “See what has
      happened to poor me. The ocean seized my eggs today. I told
      you more than once that we should move, but you were stupid
      as Fatalist and would not go. Now I am so sad at the loss of
      my children that I have decided to burn myself.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“My dear,” said the plover, “wait until you witness my
      power, until I dry up that rascally ocean with my bill.” But
      she replied: “My dear husband, how can you fight the ocean?
      Furthermore,</p>
      <pre>
Gay simpletons who fight,
Not estimating right
The foe's power and their own,
Like moths in flame atone.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“My dear,” said the plover, “you should not say such
      things.</p>
      <pre>
The sun's new-risen beams
Upon the mountains fall:
Where glory is cognate,
Age matters not at all.
</pre>

      <p>With this bill I shall dry up the water to the last drop,
      and turn the sea into dry land.” “Darling,” said his wife,
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n146.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x150" src="hertel2/n146.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      “with a bill that holds one drop how will you  dry up
      the ocean, into which pour without ceasing the Ganges and the
      Indus, bearing the water of nine times nine hundred tributary
      streams? Why talk nonsense?” But the plover said:</p>
      <pre>
Success is rooted in the will;
And I possess an iron-strong bill;
Long days and nights before me lie:
Why should not ocean's flood go dry?

The highest glory to attain
Asks enterprise and manly strain:
The sun must first to Libra climb
Before he routs the cloudy time.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Well,” said his wife, “if you feel that you must make war
      on the ocean, at least call other birds to your aid before
      you begin. For the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
A host where each is weak
    Brings victory to pass:
The elephant is bound
    By woven ropes of grass.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
Woodpecker and sparrow
    With froggy and gnat,
Attacking <i>en masse</i>, laid
    The elephant flat.”

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“How was that?” asked Sprawl. And Constance told the story

      <h2><a href="#TOC">The Duel Between Elephant and
      Sparrow</a></h2>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>In a dense bit of jungle lived a sparrow and his wife, who
      had built their nest on the branch of a tamal tree, and in
      course of time a family appeared.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now one day a jungle elephant with the spring fever was
      distressed by the heat, and came beneath that tamal tree in
      search of shade. Blinded by his fever, he pulled with the tip
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n147.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x151" src="hertel2/n147.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      of his trunk at the branch  where the sparrows had their
      nest, and broke it. In the process the sparrows’ eggs were
      crushed, though the parent-birds—further life being
      predestined—barely escaped death.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then the hen-sparrow lamented, desolate with grief at the
      death of her chicks. And presently, hearing her lamentation,
      a woodpecker bird, a great friend of hers, came grieved at
      her grief, and said: “My dear friend, why lament in vain? For
      the Scripture says:</p>
      <pre>
For lost and dead and past
    The wise have no laments:
Between the wise and fools
    Is just this difference.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
No life deserves lament;
    Fools borrow trouble,
Add sadness to the sad,
    So make it double.
</pre>

      <p>And yet again:</p>
      <pre>
Since kinsmen's sticky tears
    Clog the departed,
Bury them decently,
    Tearless, whole-hearted.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“That is good doctrine,” said the hen-sparrow, “but what
      of it? This elephant—curse his spring fever!—killed my
      babies. So if you are my friend, think of some plan to kill
      this big elephant. If that were done, I should feel less
      grief at the death of my children. You know the saying:</p>
      <pre>
While one brings comfort in distress,
    Another jeers at pain;
By paying both as they deserve,
    A man is born again.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Madam,” said the woodpecker, “your remark is very true.
      For the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
A friend in need is a friend indeed,
    Although of different caste;
The whole world is your eager friend
    So long as riches last.
</pre>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n148.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x152" src="hertel2/n148.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>And again: </p>
      <pre>
A friend in need is a friend indeed;
Fathers indeed are those who feed;
True comrades they, and wives indeed,
Whence trust and sweet content proceed.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Now see what my wit can devise. But you must know that I,
      too, have a friend, a gnat called Lute-Buzz. I will return
      with her, so that this villainous beast of an elephant may be
      killed.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So he went with the hen-sparrow, found the gnat, and said:
      “Dear madam, this is my friend the hen-sparrow. She is
      mourning because a villainous elephant smashed her eggs. So
      you must lend your assistance while I work out a plan for
      killing him.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“My good friend,” said the gnat, “there is only one
      possible answer. But I also have a very intimate friend, a
      frog named Cloud-Messenger. Let us do the right thing by
      calling him into consultation. For the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
A wise companion find,
Shrewd, learned, righteous, kind;
For plans by him designed
Are never undermined.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So all three went together and told Cloud-Messenger the
      entire story. And the frog said: “How feeble a thing is that
      wretched elephant when pitted against a great throng enraged!
      Gnat, you must go and buzz in his fevered ear, so that he may
      shut his eyes in delight at hearing your music. Then the
      woodpecker’s bill will peck out his eyes. After that I will
      sit on the edge of a pit and croak. And he, being thirsty,
      will hear me, and will approach expecting to find a body of
      water. When he comes to the pit, he will fall in and
      perish.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When they carried out the plan, the fevered elephant shut
      his eyes in delight at the song of the gnat, was blinded by
      the woodpecker, wandered thirst-smitten at noonday, followed
      the croak of a frog, came to a great pit, fell in, and
      died.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n149.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x153" src="hertel2/n149.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>“And that is why I say: </p>
      <pre>
Woodpecker and sparrow, . . . .
</pre>

      <p>and the rest of it.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Very well,” said the plover. “I will assemble my friends
      and dry up the ocean.” With this in mind, he summoned all the
      birds and related his grief at the rape of his chicks. And
      they started to beat the ocean with their wings, as a means
      of bringing relief to his sorrow.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>But one bird said: “Our desires will not be accomplished
      in this manner. Let us rather fill up the ocean with clods
      and dust.” So they all brought what clods and dust they could
      carry in the hollow of their bills and started to fill up the
      ocean.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then another bird said: “It is plain that we are not equal
      to a contest with mighty ocean. So I will tell you what is
      now timely. There is an old gander who lives beside a banyan
      tree, who will give us sound and practical advice. Let us go
      and ask him. For there is a saying:</p>
      <pre>
Take old folks' counsel (those are old
    Who have experience)
The captive wild-goose flock was freed
    By one old gander's sense.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“How was that?” asked the birds. And the speaker told the
      story of</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>
    </div>

    <div id="the-shrewd-old-gander">
      <h2><a href="#TOC">The Shrewd Old Gander</a></h2>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>In a part of a forest was a fig tree with massive
      branches. In it lived a flock of wild geese. At the root of
      this tree appeared a creeping vine of the species called
      <em>koshambi</em>. Thereupon the old gander said: “This vine
      that is climbing our fig tree bodes ill to us. By means of
      it, someone might perhaps climb up here some day and kill us.
      Take it away while it is still slender and readily cut.” But
      the geese despised his counsel and did not cut the vine, so
      that in course of time it wound its way up the tree.
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n150.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x154" src="hertel2/n150.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      </p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now one day when the geese were out foraging, a hunter
      climbed the fig tree by following the spiral vine, laid a
      snare among the nests, and went home.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When the geese, after food and recreation, returned at
      nightfall, they were caught to the last one. Whereupon the
      old gander said: “Well, the disaster has taken place. You are
      caught, having brought it on yourselves by not heeding my
      advice. We are all lost now.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then the geese said to him: “Sir, the thing having come to
      pass, what ought we to do now?” And the old fellow replied:
      “If you will take my advice, play dead when that hateful
      hunter comes. And when the hunter, inferring that we are
      dead, throws the last one to the ground, we then must all
      rise simultaneously, flying over his head.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>At early dawn the hunter arrived, and when he looked them
      over, everyone seemed as good as dead. He therefore freed
      them from the snare with perfect assurance, and threw them
      all to the ground, one after the other. But when they saw him
      preparing to descend, they all followed the shrewd plan of
      the old gander and flew up simultaneously.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“And that is why I say:</p>
      <pre>
Take old folks' counsel, ....
</pre>

      <p>and the rest of it.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When the story had been told, all the birds visited the
      old gander and related their grief at the rape of the chicks.
      Then the old gander said: “The king of us all is Garuda.
      Therefore, the timely course of action is this. You must all
      stir the feelings of Garuda by a chorus of wailing
      lamentation. In consequence, he will remove our sorrow.” With
      this purpose they sought Garuda.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now Garuda had just been summoned by blessèd Vishnu to
      take part in an impending battle between gods and demons. At

      the king of the birds, what sorrow in the separation of loved
      ones had been wrought by the ocean when he seized the chicks.
      “O bird divine,” they said, “while you gleam in royal
      radiance, we must live on what little is won by the labor of
      our bills. Because of our weak necessity of eating, the ocean
      has, in overbearing manner, carried away our young. Now there
      is a saying:</p>
      <pre>
The poor are in peculiar need
Of being secret when they feed:
The lion killed the ram who could
Not check his appetite for food.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“How was that?” asked Garuda. And an old bird told the
      story of</p>

      <h2><a href="#TOC">The Lion and the Ram</a></h2>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>In a part of a forest was a ram, separated from his flock.
      In the armor of his great fleece and horns, he roamed the
      wood, a tough customer.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now one day a lion in that forest, who had a retinue of
      all kinds of animals, encountered him. At this unprecedented
      sight, since the wool so bristled in every direction as to
      conceal the body, the lion’s heart was troubled and invaded
      by fear. “Surely, he is more powerful than I am,” thought he.
      “That is why he wanders here so fearlessly.” And the lion
      edged away.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>But on a later day the lion saw the same ram cropping
      grass on the forest floor, and he thought: “What! The fellow
      nibbles grass! His strength must be in relation to his diet.”
      So he made a quick spring and killed the ram.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“And that is why I say:</p>
      <pre>
The poor are in peculiar need
Of being secret when they feed,
</pre>

      <p>and the rest of it.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>While they were thus conferring, Vishnu’s messenger
      returned and said: “Garuda, Lord Vishnu sends orders that you
      repair at once to the celestial city.” On hearing this,
      Garuda proudly said to him: “Messenger, what will the master
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n152.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x156" src="hertel2/n152.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      do with so poor a  servant as I am?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Garuda,” said the messenger, “it may be that the blessèd
      one has spoken to you harshly. But why should you display
      pride toward the blessèd one?” And Garuda replied: “The
      ocean, the resting-place of the blessed one, has stolen the
      eggs of the plover, who is my servant. If I do not chastise
      him, then I am not the servant of the blessed one. Make this
      report to the master.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now when Vishnu learned from the messenger’s lips that
      Garuda was feigning anger, he thought: “Ah, he is dreadfully
      angry. I will therefore go in person, will address him, and
      bring him back with all honor. For the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
Shame no servant showing worth,
Loyalty, and noble birth;
Pet him ever like a son,
If you wish your business done.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
Masters, fully satisfied,
Pay by gratifying pride;
Servants, for such honor's pay,
Gladly throw their lives away.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Having reached this conclusion, he hastened to Garuda,
      who, beholding his master a visitor in his own house,
      modestly gazed on the ground, bowed low, and said: “O blessèd
      one, the ocean, made insolent by his service as your
      resting-place, has stolen—behold! has stolen the eggs of my
      servant, and thus brought shame upon me. From reverence for
      the blessèd one, I have delayed. But if nothing is done, I
      myself will this day reduce him to dry land. For the proverb
      says:</p>
      <pre>
A loyal servant dies, but shrinks
    From doing deeds of such a kind
As bring contempt from common men
    And lower him in his master's mind.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>To this the blessèd one replied: “O son of Vinata, your
      speech is justified. Because</p>
      <pre>
For servants' crimes the master should
Be made to suffer, say the good,
So long as he does not erase
From service, cruel folk and base.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n153.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x157" src="hertel2/n153.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>“Come, then, so that we may recover the eggs  from
      ocean, may satisfy the plover, and then proceed to the
      celestial city on the gods’ business.” To this Garuda agreed,
      and the blessèd one reproached the ocean, then fitted the
      fire-arrow to his bow and said: “Villain, give the plover his
      eggs. Else, I will reduce you to dry land.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>On hearing this, the ocean, while all his train shook with
      fright, tremblingly took the eggs and restored them to the
      plover, as the blessèd one directed.</p>
      </div><div class="outer-frame-story">

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“And that is why I say:</p>

He loses fights who fights before
    His foeman's power is reckoned, ....
</pre>

      <p>and the rest of it.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now when Lively understood the matter, he asked Victor:
      “Tell me, comrade. What is his fighting technique?” And
      Victor answered: “Formerly he would lie carelessly on a slab
      of stone, with limbs relaxed. If today his tail is drawn in
      at the very first, if his four paws are bunched and his ears
      pricked up, and if he is watching for you while you are still
      far off, then you may understand that he has treachery in
      mind.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Hereupon Victor visited Cheek, who asked: “What have you
      accomplished?” And he replied: “I have already set them at
      odds with each other.” “Have you really done it?” said Cheek.
      And Victor answered: “The outcome will show you.” “Indeed,”
      said Cheek, “it is not surprising. For the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
A well-devised estranging scheme
    The firmest prudence shocks,
As constant floods of water split
    The mountains' close-piled rocks.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then Victor continued: “Having wrought an estrangement, a
      man should not fail to seek his own advantage in it. As the
      verse puts it:</p>
      <pre>
The man who studies every book
And understands, yet does not look
To his advantage, learns in vain;
His books are merely mental strain.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“But in the final analysis,” said Cheek, “there is no such
      thing as personal advantage. For</p>
      <pre>
Since worms and filth and ashes cling,
The body is a loathsome thing;
What statecraft therefore may there be
In hurting it vicariously?”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Ah,” replied Victor, “you have no comprehension of the
      devious ways of statesmanship, the basic support of the
      profession of counselor. On this point there is a verse:</p>
      <pre>
Let your speech like sugar be,
Steel your heart remorselessly;
Never draw a doubtful breath:
Pay for suffered wrongs with death.
</pre>

      <p>And another thing. This Lively, even when killed, will
      provide us with nourishment. For you know,</p>
      <pre>
The wise who wrongs another,
    Pursuing selfish good,
Should keep his plans a secret,
    As Smart did in the wood.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“How was that?” asked Cheek. And Victor told the story

      <h2><a href="#TOC">Smart, the Jackal</a></h2>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>In a part of a forest lived a lion named Thunder-Fang,
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n154.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x158" src="hertel2/n154.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>       in company with three counselors, a wolf, a jackal, and
      a camel, whose names were Meat-Face, Smart, and Spike-Ear.
      One day he fought with a furious elephant whose sharp-pointed
      tusk so tore his body that he withdrew from the world.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then, suffering from a seven-day fast, his body lean with
      hunger, he said to his famished advisers: “Round up some
      creature in the forest, so that, even in my present
      condition, I may provide needed nourishment for you.” The
      moment he issued his orders, they roamed the wood, but found
      nothing.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Thereupon Smart reflected: “If Spike-Ear here were killed,
      then we should all be nourished for a few days. However, the
      master is kept from killing him by friendly feeling. In spite
      of that, my wit will put the master in a frame of mind to
      kill him. For, indeed,</p>
      <pre>
All understanding may be won,
All things be slain, and all be done,
If mortals have sufficient wit;
For me, I make good use of it.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>After these reflections, he said to Spike-Ear: “Friend
      Spike-Ear, the master lacks wholesome food, and is starving.
      If the master goes, our death is also a certain thing. So I
      have a suggestion for your benefit and the master’s. Please
      pay attention.” “My good fellow,” said Spike-Ear, “make haste
      to inform me, so that I may unhesitatingly do as you say.
      Besides, one earns credit for a hundred good deeds by serving
      his master.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>And Smart said: “My good fellow, give your own body at 100
      per cent interest, so that you may receive a double body, and
      the master may prolong his life.” On hearing this proposal,
      Spike-Ear said: “If that is possible, my friend, my body
      shall be so devoted. Tell the master that this thing should
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n155.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x159" src="hertel2/n155.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      be done. I stipulate  only that the Death-God be
      requested to guarantee the bargain.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Having made their decision, they all went to visit the
      lion, and Smart said: “O King, we did not find a thing today,
      and the blessed sun is already near his setting.” On hearing
      this, the lion fell into deep despondency. Then Smart
      continued: “O King, our friend Spike-Ear makes this proposal:
      ‘If you call upon the Death-God to guarantee the bargain, and
      if you render it back with 100 per cent of interest, then I
      will give my body.’” “My good fellow,” answered the lion,
      “yours is a beautiful act. Let it be as you say.” On the
      basis of this pact, Spike-Ear was struck down by the lion’s
      paw, his body was torn by the wolf and the jackal, and he
      died.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then Smart reflected: “How can I get him all to myself to
      eat?” With this thought in his mind, he noticed that the
      lion’s body was smeared with blood, and he said: “Master, you
      must go to the river to bathe and worship the gods, while I
      stay here with Meat-Face to guard the food-supply.” On
      hearing this, the lion went to the river.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When the lion was gone, Smart said to Meat-Face: “Friend
      Meat-Face, you are starving. You might eat some of this camel
      before the old master returns. I will make your apologies to
      the master.” So Meat-Face took the hint, but had only taken a
      taste when Smart cried: “Drop it, Meat-Face. The master is
      coming.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Presently the lion returned, saw that the camel was minus
      a heart, and wrathfully roared: “Look here! Who turned this
      camel into leavings? I wish to kill him, too.” Then Meat-Face
      peered into Smart’s visage, as much as to say: “Come, now!
      Say something, so that he may calm down.” But Smart laughed
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n156.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x160" src="hertel2/n156.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      and said: “Come, come! You ate the camel’s  heart all by
      yourself. Why do you look at me?” And Meat-Face, hearing
      this, fled for his life, making for another country. But when
      the lion had pursued him a short distance, he turned back,
      thinking: “He, too, is unguipugnacious. I must not kill
      him.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>At this moment, as fate would have it, there came that way
      a great camel caravan, heavily laden, making a tremendous
      jingling with the bells tied to the camels’ necks. And when
      the lion heard the jingle of the bells, loud even in the
      distance, he said to the jackal: “My good fellow, find out
      what this horrible noise may be.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>On receiving this commission, Smart advanced a little in
      the forest, then darted back, and cried in great excitement:
      “Run, master! Run, if you can run!”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“My good fellow,” said the lion, “why terrify me so? Tell
      me what it is.” And Smart cried: “Master, the Death-God is
      coming, and he is in a rage against you because you brought
      untimely death upon his camel, and had him guarantee the
      bargain. He intends to make you pay a thousand fold for his
      camel. He has immense pride in his camels. He also plans to
      make inquiries about the father and grandfathers of that one.
      He is coming. He is near at hand.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When the lion heard this, he, too, abandoned the dead
      camel and scampered for dear life. Whereupon Smart ate the
      camel bit by bit, so that the meat lasted a long time.</p>
      </div><div class="outer-frame-story">

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“And that is why I say:</p>

The wise who wrongs another,
    Pursuing selfish good, ....
</pre>

      <p>and the rest of it.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now when Victor was gone, Lively reflected: “What am I to
      do? Suppose I go elsewhere, then some other merciless
      creature will kill me, for this is a wild wood. Indeed, when
      the master is furious, it is not possible even to depart. For
      the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
Impunity comes not
    By fleeing far away:
The long arms of the shrewd
    Make careless sinners pay.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“My best course is to approach the lion. He might regard
      me as a suppliant, might even spare my life.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n157.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x161" src="hertel2/n157.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>Having thus set his mind in order, he started very 
      slowly, with troubled spirit, and when he perceived the lion
      in the posture foretold by Victor, he sank down at some
      little distance, thinking: “Ah, the unfathomable character of
      kings! As the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
'Tis a house with serpents crawling,
Wood with beasts of prey appalling,
Lotus-pond where blossoms smile
O'er the lurking crocodile,
Spot that sneaking rogues deface
With repeated slanders base&mdash;
Timid servant never learns
Whither kingly purpose turns.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Rusty for his part, perceiving the bull in the attitude
      predicted by Victor, made a sudden spring at him. And Lively,
      though his body was torn by sharp claws as formidable as
      thunderbolts, also scored the lion’s belly with his horns,
      contrived to break away from him, and stood in fighting
      posture, ready to gore again.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>At this point Cheek perceived that both of them, red as
      dhak trees in blossom, were intent on killing each other, and
      he said reproachfully to Victor: “You dunderhead! In setting
      these two at enmity, you have done a wicked deed. You have
      brought trouble and confusion into this entire forest, thus
      proving your ignorance of the true nature of statecraft. For
      the saying runs:</p>
      <pre>
Those are counselors indeed,
Wise in statecraft, who succeed
In composing reckless strife
That, unhindered, threatens life:
Those on petty purpose bent,
Keen to visit punishment,
Quick in wrong and folly, bring
Risk to kingdom and to king.
</pre>

      <p>Ah, poor fool!</p>
      <pre>
Men of true discernment, first
    Try conciliation;
For the victories of peace
    Suffer no frustration.
</pre>

      <p>Ah, poor simpleton! You seek the post of counselor, and
      are ignorant of the very name of conciliation. Your ambition
      is vain, since you love harsh measures. As the proverb puts
      it:</p>
      <pre>
Lord Brahma bids the statesman try
    Conciliation first,
Postpone or shun (it can be done)
    Harsh deeds, of all deeds worst.

'Tis neither sun nor flashing gem
    Nor fiery spark,
'Tis peace, from bitter foemen's hearts
    That routs the dark.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
Try peaceful means, not harsh, to make
    Your quarrel flit:
Take sugar, not cucumber, for
    A bilious fit.
</pre>

      <p>And once again:</p>
      <pre>
The doors that wit unlocks are three&mdash;
Peace, shrewd intrigue, and bribery;
The fourth device that brings success
In struggle, is plain manliness.

Tis womanish, no doubt, to show
    Small strength, abundant sense;
But power is merely bestial, if
    Without intelligence.

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n158.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x162" src="hertel2/n158.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>Snake, lion, elephant, and fire,                        
    With water, wind, and sun,
Have power. From undirected power
    Is little profit won.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Now if it was overweening pride in being the son of a
      counselor that has led you to outrage decency, the result
      will be merely your own ruin. As the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
What is learning whose attaining
Sees no passion wane, no reigning
    Love and self-control?
Does not make the mind a menial,
Finds in virtue no congenial
    Path and final goal?
Whose attaining is but straining
For a name, and never gaining
    Fame or peace of soul?
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Now in the treatises on the subject statesmanship is
      subsumed under five heads, to wit: proper inception;
      resources, human and material; determination of place and
      time; countermeasures for mischance; and successful
      accomplishment. At the present moment, the master finds
      himself in serious peril. So, if you have any such capacity,
      devise countermeasures for his mischance. For the wisdom of a
      counselor finds its test in the patching of friendship. Ah,
      you fool! That you cannot do, because you have a perverted
      mind. As the saying goes:</p>
      <pre>
No scamp can further others' work,
    But can deprave it:
The mole uproots the mulberry,
    But cannot save it.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“After all, the fault is not yours, but rather the
      master’s, who trusts your words, dull-witted as you are. And
      the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
Educating sluggish wit
Kills no pride but fosters it:
In the sunlight others find
Aid to vision; owls go blind.

Education thrusts aside
Man's fatuity and pride;
If it foster them, who can
Cure the educated man?
Remedies are useless when
Heaven's nectar poisons men.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>And Cheek, beholding his master in pitiful plight, sank
      into deep dejection. “Dreadful,” he cried, “dreadful is the
      penalty the master pays for taking evil counsel! Indeed,
      there is wisdom in the verse:</p>
      <pre>
Monarchs who adopt a plan
From the mean and vicious man,
Who refuse to tread the way
That the prudent counsel&mdash;they
Enter misadventure's cage
Where the adversaries rage;
Thence deliverance's gate
Crowns an issue rugged, strait.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Fool! Fool! All the world seeks the service of a master
      whose retinue is righteous. How, then, can such an evil
      counselor as you, who, like a beast, understand nothing but
      destruction—how can such a one enrich the master with
      righteous companions? For the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
Monarchs, ill-advised, repel,
Even though they purpose well:
Sweet and placid waters smile,
But beware the crocodile.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Yet you, I suppose, seeking your own advantage, desire to
      have the king quite solitary. Ah, fool! Are you ignorant of
      the verse?</p>
      <pre>
Kings shine as social beings, not
    As solitaries;
Whoever wish them lonely are
    Their adversaries.
</pre>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n159.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x163" src="hertel2/n159.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>And again: </p>
      <pre>
Draw benefit from comments harsh;
    No poison, this:
In flattery see treason, not
    True nectar's bliss.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“And if you are grieved at seeing others happy and
      prosperous, that, too, is wicked. It is wrong to proceed thus
      when friends have fulfilled their nature. For</p>
      <pre>
Those who seek, through treason, friends;
Seek, through humbug, righteous ends;
Property by wronging neighbors;
Learning's wealth by easy labors;
Woman's love by cruel pride&mdash;
These are fools, self-stultified.

      <p>“Furthermore, for one who has enjoyed the master’s favor,
      modesty is peculiarly proper. As the verse puts it:</p>

According to his favored state,
A servant's modest, humble gait
Is notably appropriate.

Great ocean is not fouled by caving shore:
For petty cause the fickle change and pass;
The gentlest breezes ruffle pliant grass.

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“When all is said, it is the master’s fault. For in
      pursuit of virtue, money, and love, he recklessly takes
      counsel with one like you—one who lives by the mere pretense
      of administrative competence, in total ignorance of the six

      there is wisdom in this:</p>
      <pre>
If kings are satisfied
With servants at their side
Who ply a wheedling tongue,
Whose bows are never strung,

Embracing manlier foes.

      <h2><a href="#TOC">The Monk Who Left His Body Behind</a></h2>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>In the Koshala country is a city called Unassailable. In
      it ruled a king named Fine-Chariot, over whose footstool
      rippled rays of light from the diadems of uncounted vassal
      princes.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>One day a forest ranger came with this report: “Master,
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n160.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x164" src="hertel2/n160.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      all the forest kings have become turbulent,  and in
      their midst is the forest chief named Vindhyaka. It is the
      king’s affair to teach him modest manners.” On hearing this
      report, the king summoned Counselor Strong, and despatched
      him with orders to chastise the forest chieftains.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now in the absence of the counselor, a naked monk arrived
      in the city at the end of the hot season. He was master of
      the astronomical specialties, such as problems and
      etymologies, rising of the zodiacal signs, augury, ecliptic
      intersection, and the decanate; also stellar mansions divided
      into nine parts, twelve parts, thirty parts; the shadow of
      the gnomon, eclipses, and numerous other mysteries. With
      these the fellow in a few days won the entire population, as
      if he had bought and paid for them.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Finally, as the matter went from mouth to mouth, the king
      heard a report of its character, and had the curiosity to
      summon the monk to his palace. There he offered him a seat
      and asked: “Is it true, Professor, as they say, that you read
      the thoughts of others?” “That will be demonstrated in the
      sequel,” replied the monk, and by discourses adapted to the
      occasion he brought the poor king to the extreme pitch of
      curiosity.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>One day he failed to appear at the regular hour, but the
      following day, on entering the palace, he announced: “O King,
      I bring you the best of good tidings. At dawn today I flung
      this body aside within my cell, assumed a body fit for the
      world of the gods, and, inspired with the knowledge that all
      the immortals thought of me with longing, I went to heaven
      and have just returned. While there, I was requested by the
      gods to inquire in their name after the king’s welfare.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When he heard this, the king said, his extreme curiosity
      begetting a feeling of amazement: “What, Professor! You go to
      heaven?” “O mighty King,” replied the fellow, “I go to heaven
      every day.” This the king believed—poor dullard!—so that he
      grew negligent of all royal business and all duties toward
      the ladies, concentrating his attention on the monk.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>While matters were in this state, Strong entered the
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n161.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x165" src="hertel2/n161.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      king’s presence, after settling all disturbances in  the
      forest domain. He found the master wholly indifferent to
      every one of his counselors, withdrawn in private conference
      with that naked monk, discussing what seemed to be some
      miraculous occurrence, his lotus-face ablossom. And on
      learning the facts, Strong bowed low and said: “Victory, O
      King! May the gods give you wit!”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Thereupon the king inquired concerning the counselor’s
      health, and said: “Sir, do you know this professor?” To which
      the counselor replied: “How could there be ignorance of one
      who is lord and creator of a whole school of professors?
      Moreover, I have heard that this professor goes to heaven. Is
      it a fact?” “Everything that you have heard,” answered the
      king, “is beyond the shadow of doubt.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Thereupon the monk said: “If this counselor feels any
      curiosity, he may see for himself.” With this he entered his
      cell, barred the door from within, and waited there. After
      the lapse of a mere moment, the counselor spoke: “O King,” he
      said, “how soon will he return?” And the king replied: “Why
      this impatience? You must know that he leaves his lifeless
      body within this cell, and returns with another, a heavenly
      body.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“If this is indeed the case,” said Strong, “then bring a
      great quantity of firewood, so that I may set fire to this
      cell.” “For what purpose?” asked the king. And the counselor
      continued: “So that, when this lifeless body has been burned,
      the gentleman may stand before the king in that other body
      which visits heaven. In this connection I will tell you the

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>In Palace City lived a Brahman named Godly, whose
      childless wife wept bitterly when she saw the neighbors’
      youngsters. But one day the Brahman said: “Forget your
      sorrow, mother dear. See! When I was offering the sacrifice
      for birth of children, an invisible being said to me in the
      clearest words: ‘Brahman, you shall have a son surpassing all
      mankind in beauty, character, and charm.’”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n162.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x166" src="hertel2/n162.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>When she heard this, the wife felt her heart swell 
      with supreme delight. “I only hope his promises come true,”
      she said. Presently she conceived, and in course of time gave
      birth to a snake. When she saw him, she paid no attention to
      her companions, who all advised her to throw him away.
      Instead, she took him and bathed him, laid him with motherly
      tenderness in a large, clean box, and pampered him with milk,
      fresh butter, and other good things, so that before many days
      had passed, he grew to maturity.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>But one day the Brahman’s wife was watching the marriage
      festival of a neighbor’s son, and the tears streamed down her
      face as she said to her husband: “I know that you despise me,
      because you do nothing about a marriage festival for my boy.”
      “My good wife,” answered he, “am I to go to the depths of the
      underworld and beseech Vasuki the serpent-king? Who else, you
      foolish woman, would give his own daughter to this
      snake?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>But when he had spoken, he was disturbed at seeing the
      utter woe in his wife’s countenance. He therefore packed
      provisions for a long journey, and undertook foreign travel
      from love of his wife. In the course of some months he
      arrived at a spot called Kutkuta City in a distant land.
      There in the house of a kinsman whom he could visit with
      pleasure since each respected the other’s character, he was
      hospitably received, was given a bath, food, and the like,
      and there he spent the night.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now at dawn, when he paid his respects to his Brahman host
      and made ready to depart, the other asked him: “What was your
      purpose in coming hither? And where will your errand lead
      you?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>To this he replied: “I have come in search of a fit wife
      for my son.” “In that case,” said his host, “I have a very
      beautiful daughter, and my own person is yours to command.
      Pray take her for your son.” So the Brahman took the girl
      with her attendants and returned to his own place.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>But when the people of the country beheld her incomparable
      opulence of beauty, her supreme loveliness and superhuman
      graces, their eyes popped out with pleasure, and they said to
      her attendants: “How can right-thinking persons bestow such a
      pearl of a girl upon a snake?” On hearing this, all her
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n163.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x167" src="hertel2/n163.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      elderly  relatives without exception were troubled at
      heart, and they said: “Let her be taken from this imp-ridden
      creature.” But the girl said: “No more of this mockery!
      Remember the text:</p>
      <pre>
Do once, once only, these three things:
Once spoken, stands the word of kings;
The speech of saints has no miscarriage;

      <p>Whereupon they all asked in chorus: “Who was this Blossom

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>God Indra once had a parrot named Blossom. He enjoyed
      supreme beauty, loveliness, and various graces, while his
      intelligence was not blunted by his extensive scientific
      attainments.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>One day he was resting on the palm of great Indra’s hand,
      his body thrilling with delight at that contact, and was
      reciting a variety of authoritative formulas, when he caught
      sight of Yama, lord of death, who had come to pay his
      respects at the time appointed. Seeing the god, the parrot
      edged away. And all the thronging immortals asked him: “Why
      did you move away, sir, upon beholding that personage?”
      “But,” said the parrot, “he brings harm to all living
      creatures. Why not move away from him?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Upon hearing this, they all desired to calm his fears, so
      said to Yama: “As a favor to us, you must please not kill
      this parrot.” And Yama replied: “I do not know about that. It
      is Time who determines these matters.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>They therefore took Blossom with them, paid a visit to
      Time, and made the same request. To which Time replied: “It
      is Death who is posted in these affairs. Pray speak to
      him.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>But when they did so, the parrot died at the mere sight of
      Death. And they were all distressed at seeing the occurrence,
      so that they said to Yama: “What does this mean?” And Yama
      said: “It was simply fated that he should die at the mere
      sight of Death.” With this reply they went back to
      heaven.</p>

      <p>and the rest of it. Furthermore, I do not wish my father
      reproached for double dealing on the part of his daughter.”
      When she had said this, she married the snake, with the
      permission of her companions, and at once began devoted
      attendance upon him by offering milk to drink and performing
      other services.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>One night the serpent issued from the generous chest which
      had been set for him in her chamber, and entered her bed.
      “Who is this?” she cried. “He has the form of a man.” And
      thinking him a strange man, she started up, trembling in
      every limb, unlocked the door, and was about to dart away
      when she heard him say: “Stay, my dear wife. I am your
      husband.” Then, in order to convince her, he re-entered the
      body which he had left behind in the chest, issued from it
      again, and came to her.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When she beheld him flashing with lofty diadem, with
      earrings, bracelets, armbands, and rings, she fell at his
      feet, and then they sank into a glad embrace. Now his father,
      the Brahman, rose betimes and discovered how matters stood.
      He therefore seized the serpent’s skin that lay in the chest,
      and consumed it with fire, for he thought: “I do not want him
      to enter that again.” And in the morning he and his wife,
      with the greatest possible joy, introduced to everybody as
      their own an extraordinarily handsome son, quite wrapped up
      in his love affair.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>In a certain city lived two friends, sons of merchants,
      and their names were Right-Mind and Wrong-Mind. These two
      traveled to another country far away in order to earn money.
      There the one named Right-Mind, as a consequence of favoring
      fortune, found a pot containing a thousand dinars, which had
      been hidden long before by a holy man. He debated the matter
      with Wrong-Mind, and they decided to go home, since their
      object was attained. So they returned together.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When they drew near their native city, Right-Mind said:
      “My good friend, a half of this falls to your share. Pray
      take it, so that, now that we are at home, we may cut a
      brilliant figure before our friends and those less
      friendly.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>But Wrong-Mind, with a sneaking thought of his own
      advantage, said to the other: “My good friend, so long as we
      two hold this treasure in common, so long will our virtuous
      friendship suffer no interruption. Let us each take a hundred
      dinars, and go to our homes after burying the remainder. The
      decrease or increase of this treasure will serve as a test of
      our virtue.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now Right-Mind, in the nobility of his nature, did not
      comprehend the hidden duplicity of his friend, and agreed to
      the proposal. Each then took a certain sum of money. They
      carefully hid the residue in the ground, and made their
      entrance into the city.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n167.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x171" src="hertel2/n167.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      <p>Before long, Wrong-Mind exhausted his preliminary 
      portion because he practiced the vice of unwise expenditure
      and because his predetermined fate offered vulnerable points.
      He therefore made a second division with Right-Mind, each
      taking a second hundred. Within a year this, too, had slipped
      in the same way through Wrong-Mind’s fingers. As a result,
      his thoughts took this form: “Suppose I divide another two
      hundred with him, then what is the good of the remainder, a
      paltry four hundred, even if I steal it? I think I prefer to
      steal a round six hundred.” After this meditation, he went
      alone, removed the treasure, and leveled the ground.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>A mere month later, he took the initiative, going to
      Right-Mind and saying: “My good friend, let us divide the
      rest of the money equally.” So he and Right-Mind visited the
      spot and began to dig. When the excavation failed to reveal
      any treasure, that impudent Wrong-Mind first of all smote his
      own head with the empty pot, then shouted: “What became of
      that good lucre? Surely, Right-Mind, you must have stolen it.
      Give me my half. If you don’t, I will bring you into
      court.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Be silent, villain!” said the other. “My name is
      Right-Mind. Such thefts are not in my line. You know the
      verse:</p>
      <pre>
A man right-minded sees but trash,
Mere clods of earth, in others' cash;
A mother in his neighbor's wife;
In all that lives, his own dear life.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So together they carried their dispute to court and
      related the theft of the money. And when the magistrates
      learned the facts, they decreed an ordeal for each. But
      Wrong-Mind said: “Come! This judgment is not proper. For the
      legal dictum runs:</p>
      <pre>
Best evidence is written word;
Next, witnesses who saw and heard;
Then only let ordeals prevail
When witnesses completely fail.
</pre>

      <p>In the present case, I have a witness, the goddess of the
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n168.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x172" src="hertel2/n168.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      wood. She will reveal to you which one of us is  guilty,
      which not guilty. And they replied: “You are quite right,
      sir. For there is a further saying:</p>
      <pre>
To meanest witnesses, ordeals
    Should never be preferred;
Of course much less, if you possess
    A forest goddess' word.
</pre>

      <p>Now we also feel a great interest in the case. You two
      must accompany us tomorrow morning to that part of the
      forest.” With this they accepted bail from each and sent them
      home.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then Wrong-Mind went home and asked his father’s help.
      “Father dear,” said he, “the dinars are in my hand. They only
      require one little word from you. This very night I am going
      to hide you out of sight in a hole in the mimosa tree that
      grows near the spot where I dug out the treasure before. In
      the morning you must be my witness in the presence of the
      magistrates.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Oh, my son,” said the father, “we are both lost. This is
      no kind of a scheme. There is wisdom in the old story:</p>
      <pre>
The good and bad of given schemes
    Wise thought must first reveal:
The stupid heron saw his chicks
    Provide a mungoose meal.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“How was that?” asked Wrong-Mind. And his father told the
      story of</p>

    <div id="a-remedy-worse-than-the-disease">
      <h2><a href="#TOC">A Remedy Worse Than the Disease</a></h2>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>A flock of herons once had their nests on a fig tree in a
      part of a forest. In a hole in the tree lived a black snake
      who made a practice of eating the heron chicks before their
      wings sprouted.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>At last one heron, in utter woe at seeing the young ones
      eaten by a snake, went to the shore of the pond, shed a flood
      of tears, and stood with downcast face. And a crab who
      noticed him in this attitude, said: “Uncle, why are you so
      tearful today?” “My good friend,” said the heron, “what am I
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n169.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x173" src="hertel2/n169.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      to do? Fate is  against me. My babies and the youngsters
      belonging to my relatives have been eaten by a snake that
      lives in a hole in the fig tree. Grieved at their grief, I
      weep. Tell me, is there any possible device for killing
      him?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>On hearing this, the crab reflected: “After all, he is a
      natural-born enemy of my race. I will give him such advice—a
      kind of true lie—that other herons may also perish. For the
      proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
Let your speech like butter be;
Steel your heart remorselessly:
Stir an enemy to action
That destroys him with his faction.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>And he said aloud: “Uncle, conditions being as they are,
      scatter bits of fish all the way from the mungoose burrow to
      the snake’s hole. The mungoose will follow that trail and
      will destroy the villainous snake.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When this had been done, the mungoose followed the bits of
      fish, killed the villainous snake, and also ate at his
      leisure all the herons who made their home in the tree.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“And that is why I say:</p>
      <pre>
The good and bad of given schemes, ....
</pre>

      <p>and the rest of it.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>But Wrong-Mind disdained the paternal warning, and during
      the night he hid his father out of sight in the hole in the
      tree. When morning came, the scamp took a bath, put on clean
      garments, and followed Right-Mind and the magistrates to the
      mimosa tree, where he cried in piercing tones:</p>
      <pre>
“Earth, heaven, and death, the feeling mind,
Sun, moon, and water, fire and wind,
Both twilights, justice, day and night
Discern man's conduct, wrong or right.
</pre>

      <p>O blessèd goddess of the wood, which of us two is the
      thief? Speak.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then Wrong-Mind’s father spoke from his hole in the
      mimosa: “Gentlemen, Right-Mind took that money.” And when all
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n170.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x174" src="hertel2/n170.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      the king’s men heard this  statement, their eyes
      blossomed with astonishment, and they searched their minds to
      discover the appropriate legal penalty for stealing money, in
      order to visit it on Right-Mind.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Meanwhile Right-Mind heaped inflammable matter about the
      hole in the mimosa and set fire to it. As the mimosa burned,
      Wrong-Mind’s father issued from the hole with a pitiful wail,
      his body scorched and his eyes popping out. And they all
      asked: “Why, sir! What does this mean?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“It is all Wrong-Mind’s doing,” he replied. Whereupon the
      king’s men hanged Wrong-Mind to a branch of the mimosa, while
      they commended Right-Mind and caused him satisfaction by
      conferring upon him the king’s favor and other things.</p>

Fate condemns to ruin all
Who within his clutches fall.

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>In a certain town lived a merchant named Naduk, who lost
      his money and determined to travel abroad. For</p>
      <pre>
The meanest of mankind is he
    Who, having lost his money, can
Inhabit lands or towns where once
    He spent it like a gentleman.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
The neighbor gossips blame
His poverty as shame
Who long was wont to play
Among them, proud and gay.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>In his house was an iron balance-beam inherited from his
      ancestors, and it weighed a thousand <em>pals</em>. This he
      put in pawn with Merchant Lakshman before he departed for
      foreign countries.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now after he had long traveled wherever business led him
      through foreign lands, he returned to his native city and
      said to Merchant Lakshman: “Friend Lakshman, return my
      deposit, the balance-beam.” And Lakshman said: “Friend Naduk,
      your balance-beam has been eaten by mice.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>To this Naduk replied: “Lakshman, you are in no way to
      blame, if it has been eaten by mice. Such is life. Nothing in
      the universe has any permanence. However, I am going to the
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n172.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x176" src="hertel2/n172.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      river for a bath. Please  send your boy Money-God with
      me, to carry my bathing things.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Since Lakshman was conscience-stricken at his own theft,
      he said to his son Money-God: “My dear boy, let me introduce
      Uncle Naduk, who is going to the river to bathe. You must go
      with him and carry his bathing things.” Ah, there is too much
      truth in the saying:</p>
      <pre>
There is no purely loving deed
Without a pinch of fear or greed
Or service of a selfish need.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
Wherever there is fond attention
That does not seek a service pension,
Was there no timid apprehension?
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>So Lakshman’s son took the bathing things and delightedly
      accompanied Naduk to the river. After Naduk had taken his
      bath, he thrust Lakshman’s son Money-God into a mountain
      cave, blocked the entrance with a great rock, and returned to
      Lakshman’s house. And when Lakshman said: “Friend Naduk, tell
      me what has become of my son Money-God who went with you,”
      Naduk answered: “My good Lakshman, a hawk carried him off
      from the river-bank.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Oh, Naduk!” cried Lakshman. “You liar! How could a hawk
      possibly carry off a big boy like Money-God?” “But,
      Lakshman,” retorted Naduk, “the mice could eat a balance-beam
      made of iron. Give me my balance-beam, if you want your
      son.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Finally, they carried their dispute to the palace gate,
      where Lakshman cried in a piercing tone: “Help! Help! A
      ghastly deed! This Naduk person has carried off my son—his
      name is Money-God.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Thereupon the magistrates said to Naduk: “Sir, restore the
      boy to Lakshman.” But Naduk pleaded: “What am I to do? Before
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n173.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x177" src="hertel2/n173.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      my eyes a hawk carried  him from the river-bank.” “Come,
      Naduk!” said they, “you are not telling the truth. How can a
      hawk carry off a fifteen-year-old boy?” Then Naduk laughed
      outright and said: “Gentlemen, listen to my words.</p>
      <pre>
Where mice eat balance-beams of iron
    A thousand <i>pals</i> in weight,
A hawk might steal an elephant;
    A boy is trifling freight.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“How was that?” they asked, and Naduk told them the story
      of the balance-beam. At this they laughed and caused the
      restoration of balance-beam and boy to the respective
      owners.</p>

      <p>On a part of a mountain a hen-parrot brought two chicks
      into the world. These chicks were caught by a hunter when the
      mother had left the nest to search for food. One of
      them—since fate decreed it—contrived to escape, while the
      other was kept in a cage and taught to speak. Meanwhile, the
      first chick encountered a wandering holy man, who caught him,
      took him to his own hermitage, and gave him kindly care.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>While time was passing in this manner, a certain king,
      whose horse ran away and separated him from his guard, came
      to that part of the forest where the hunters lived. The
      moment he perceived the king’s approach, the parrot
      straightway began to chuckle from his cage: “Come, come, my
      masters! Here comes somebody riding a horse. Bind him, bind
      him! Kill him, kill him!” And when the king heard the
      parrot’s words, he quickly spurred his horse in another
      direction.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now when the king came to another wood far away, he saw a

      him water to wash his feet in the cool shade of this
      tree.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When he heard this, the king’s eyes blossomed wide, and he

      parrot who looked like you, but who had a cruel disposition.
      ‘Bind him, bind him!’ he cried; ‘kill him, kill him!’” And

      <p>There was once a prince who made friends with a merchant’s
      son and the son of a man of learning. Every day the three
      found entertainment in various diversions, flirtations, and
      pastimes in public squares, parks, and gardens. Every day the
      prince showed his aversion to the science of archery, to
      equitation and elephant-riding, to driving and hunting. At
      last, when his father one day gave him a wigging, telling him
      that he showed no aptitude for kingly pursuits, he disclosed
      to his two friends the injury inflicted on his
      self-esteem.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>And they rejoined: “Our fathers, too, are continually
      talking nonsense when we show our aversion to their business.
      This tribulation, however, we have not noticed for many days
      because of the pleasure we took in your friendship. But now
      that we see you also grieved with the same grief, we are
      grieved exceedingly.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Thereupon the prince said: “It would be unmanly to remain

      <p>So much being determined, they considered where it was
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n176.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x180" src="hertel2/n176.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      advisable to go. And the merchant’s son said:  “You know
      that no desire is anywhere attained without money. Let us
      therefore go to Climbing Mountain, where we may find precious
      gems and enjoy every heart’s desire.” The truth of this
      presentation they all recognized, so started for Climbing
      Mountain.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>There, as fate decreed, each of them found a priceless,
      magnificent gem, whereupon they debated as follows: “How are
      we to guard these gems when we leave this spot by a forest
      trail thick with peril?” Then the son of the man of learning
      said: “You know I am the son of a counselor, and I have
      consequently thought out an appropriate plan, namely, that we
      swallow our gems and carry them in our stomachs. Thus we
      shall not be an object of interest to merchants, highwaymen,
      and other such people.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Having adopted this plan, each inserted his gem. in a
      mouthful of food at dinner time, and swallowed it. But while
      they were doing so, a fellow who was resting unperceived on
      the mountain slope, observed them and reflected: “Look here!
      I, too, have tramped Climbing Mountain for many days,
      searching for gems. But I had no luck. I found nothing. So I
      will travel with them and wherever they grow weary and go to
      sleep, I will cut their stomachs open and take all three
      gems.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>With this in mind, he came down the slope and overtook
      them, saying: “Good masters, I cannot pierce the frightful
      forest alone and reach my home. Let me join your caravan and
      travel with you.” To this they assented, for they desired the
      increase of friendliness, and the four continued their
      journey.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now in that forest, near the trail, was a Bhil village,
      nestling in a rugged bit of jungle. As the travelers passed
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n177.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x181" src="hertel2/n177.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      through its outskirts, an old bird in a  cage began to
      sing—this bird belonging to a numerous aviary kept as pets in
      the hut of the village chief.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>This chief understood the meaning that all kinds of birds
      express in their song. He therefore comprehended the old
      bird’s intention, and cried with great delight to his men:
      “Listen to what this bird tells us. He says that there are
      precious gems in the possession of yonder travelers on the
      trail, and that we ought to stop them. Catch them, and bring
      them here.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>When the robbers had done so, the chief stripped the
      travelers with his own hand, but found nothing. So he set
      them free to resume their journey, clad in loincloths only.
      But the bird sang the same story, so that the village chief
      had them brought back, and freed them only after a most
      particular and minute inspection.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Once more they started, but when the bird impatiently
      screamed the same song, the chief recalled them once more and
      questioned them, saying: “I have tested this bird time and
      again, and he never tells a lie. Now he says there are gems
      in your possession. Where are they?” And they replied: “If
      there are gems in our possession, how did your most careful
      search fail to reveal them?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>But the chief retorted: “If this bird says the thing over
      and over, the gems are certainly there, in your stomachs. It
      is now evening. At dawn I am determined to cut your stomachs
      open for gems.” After this scolding, he had them thrust into
      a dungeon.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then the captive thief reflected: “In the morning, when
      their stomachs are cut open and the chief finds such splendid
      gems, the greedy villain will be quite certain to slash my
      belly too. So my death is a certainty, whatever happens. What
      am I to do? Well, the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n178.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x182" src="hertel2/n178.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>When that last hour arrives, that none,                 
    However shrewd, may miss,
A noble spirit serves his kind,
    And death itself is bliss.
</pre>

      <p>It is best, then, to offer my own stomach first to the
      knife, saving the very men I had planned to kill. For when my
      stomach is cut open first of all and that villain finds
      nothing, grub as he may, then he will cease to suspect the
      existence of gems and, heartless though he be, will yet have
      mercy enough to renounce the cutting of the stomachs of those
      others. Thus, by giving them life and wealth I shall gain the
      glory of a generous deed in this world, and a rebirth in
      purity hereafter. This is, so to speak, a wise man’s death,
      though I did not seek the opportunity.” And so the night
      passed.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>At dawn the village chief was preparing to cut open their
      stomachs when the thief clasped his hands and humbly
      entreated him. “I cannot,” he said, “behold the cutting of
      the stomachs of these my brothers. Pray be gracious, and cut
      my stomach first.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>To this the chief mercifully agreed, but he found no sign
      of a gem in the stomach, cut as he would. Thereupon he
      penitently cried: “Woe, woe is me! Swelling with greed at the
      mere interpretation of a bird’s song, I have done a ghastly
      deed. I infer that no more gems will be found in the other
      stomachs than in this.” The three were therefore set free
      uninjured, and hastening through the forest, they reached a
      civilized spot.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>In this spot they sold all three gems, the merchant’s son
      serving as their agent. The considerable capital thus
      obtained he laid before the prince, who, having appointed the
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n179.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x183" src="hertel2/n179.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      son of the man of learning his  prime minister, planned
      to seize the kingdom of the monarch of that country, and made
      the merchant’s son his secretary of the treasury. He then, by
      offering double pay, assembled an army of picked elephants,
      horse, and infantry, began hostilities with a prime minister
      intelligent in the six expedients, killed the king in battle,
      seized his kingdom, and himself became king. Next he
      delegated all burdensome administrative functions to his two
      friends and consulted his ease in a life of graceful
      luxury.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>After a time, as he dallied now and then in the ladies’
      apartments, he made a pet and constant companion of a monkey
      from the stable near by. For it is a well-known fact that
      kings take naturally to parrots, partridges, pigeons, rams,
      monkeys, and such creatures. In course of time the monkey,
      regaled with a variety of dainties from the royal hand, grew
      to be a big fellow, and became an object of respect to the
      entire court. The king, indeed, felt such confidence in the
      monkey and such affection that he made him his personal
      sword-bearer.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Now the king had near his palace a pleasure-grove made
      charming by clumps of trees of various species. When
      springtime came, he perceived how delightful was this grove,
      since it advertised the glory of Love in the humming of
      swarms of bees, and was fragrant with the perfumes of
      crowding blossoms. He therefore entered it with his queen in
      a passion of love, and all his human retinue were left behind
      at the entrance.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>After a period of delighted wandering and gazing, the king
      grew weary and said to the monkey: “I shall rest and sleep a
      moment in this arbor. You must keep careful watch to prevent
      anyone from disturbing me.” With this he went to sleep.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Presently a bee, drawn by the fragrance of flowers, of
      musk, and other perfumes, hovered over him and alighted on
      his head. On seeing this, the monkey angrily thought: “What!
      Under my very eyes this wretched creature looks upon the
      king!” And he undertook to drive him away.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>But when the bee, for all his efforts, continued to
      approach the king, the monkey went blind with rage, drew his
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n180.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x184" src="hertel2/n180.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      sword, and fetched a blow at the bee—a  blow that split
      the king’s head.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>And the queen, who was sleeping beside him, started up in
      terror, screaming when she beheld the incomprehensible fact:
      “You fool! You monkey! The king trusted you. How could you do
      it?”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Then the monkey told what had happened, after which
      everybody, by common consent, scolded him and shunned
      him.</p>

      </div><div class="outer-frame-story">

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“So there is reason in saying that one should not make
      friends with a fool, inasmuch as the monkey killed the king.
      Indeed, that is why I say:</p>
      <pre>
To foes of sense, not foolish friends,
    'Tis wiser far to cling:
The robber for his victims died;
    The monkey killed the king.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>And Cheek continued:</p>
      <pre>
“Where <i>your</i> sort have the final word,
By whom friends' enmities are stirred,
Whose wisdom lies in tricky traps,
All efforts end in sad mishaps.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
The saint, however deep his need,
Still shuns the guilt of evil deed;
Still does the deeds that bring no shame
To honorable name and fame.
</pre>

      <p>Again:</p>
      <pre>
The wise in need still does the deed
    That keeps his honor bright:
The shell a peacock ate and dropped,
    Remains a pearly white.
</pre>

      <p>And the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
Wrong is wrong; the wise man never
    Wrong as right will treat:
None would drink, however thirsty,
    Water in the street.
</pre>

      <p>To sum it all up:</p>
      <pre>
Do the right, the right, the right,
    Till the breath of death;
Shun the wrong, although the right
    Lead to death of breath.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Hereupon, being a tortuous-minded creature to whom a
      sermon advocating such moral standards was sheer poison,
      Victor slunk away.</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>At this moment Rusty and Lively, their minds blinded by
      rage, renewed the battle. But when Rusty had killed Lively,
      his wrath subsided into pity at the memory of past affection.
      He wiped his weeping eyes with a blood-smeared paw and
      penitently said: “Ah, me! It was very wrong. Lively was
      almost my second life. In killing him, I have only hurt
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n181.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x185" src="hertel2/n181.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>      myself. For the proverb says: </p>
      <pre>
When bits are lost of royal land
Or servants true who understand,
The servants' loss is deadly pain;
Lost lands are quickly won again.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>But Victor, the impudent, perceiving that Rusty was
      mastered by irresolution, slowly crept near and said:
      “Master, what conduct is this—to show yourself irresolute
      after slaying a rival? For the saying runs:</p>
      <pre>
None leaves a father, brother, son,
    Or bosom-friend alive
Who treasonably threatens him,
    If he desires to thrive.
</pre>

      <p>Likewise:</p>
      <pre>
A king compassionate,
A careless magistrate,
A wilful wife, a friend
Whose thoughts to treason tend,
A guzzling Brahman, or
A sulky servitor,
With all who do not know
Their business&mdash;let them go.

Go however far to find
    Honest joy;
Learn from any who is wise,
    Though a boy;
Give your life, the altruist's
    Bliss to win;
Cut your very arm away,
    If it sin.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“And the morality of kings has nothing in common with that
      of ordinary men. As the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
To ruling monarchs let no trace
    Of common nature cling;
For what is vice in other men,
    Is virtue in a king.
</pre>

      <p>And once more:</p>
      <pre>
Kings' policy is fickle, like
    A woman of the town:
For now it hoards its money up,
    Now flings it careless down;
'Tis rough and flattering by turns;
    'Tis kind, and cruel too;
Exacting much and giving much,
    At once 'tis false and true.”
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Hereupon Cheek, since Victor did not return, drew near,
      sat down beside the lion, and said to Victor: “Sir, you know
      nothing of the business of administration, since the stirring
      of strife means the destruction of those who had enjoyed
      mutual friendship. It is not the practice of genuine
      counselors, when objects of ambition are attainable through
      conciliation, bribery, or intrigue, to advise the master to
      fight his own servant, so bringing him into deadly danger. As
      the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
The god of wealth, the god of war,
    The god of water, and
The god of fire have planned to win,
    Then lost the fights they planned;
For victory is not a thing
    That men or gods command.
</pre>

      <p>And besides:</p>
      <pre>
No wisdom lies in fighting, since
    It is the fools who fight;
<span class="pagenum"><a href="hertel2/n182.jpg">⛶</a><br/><img id="x186" src="hertel2/n182.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>The wise discover in wise books                         
    What course is wise and right,
And wise books in the course that is
    Not violent, delight.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Therefore a counselor should under no circumstances
      advise his master to fight. And there is another wise
      saying:</p>
      <pre>
Where the palace harbors servants
    Kindly, modest, pure,
Death to enemies, and deaf to
    Avarice's lure,
Foes may struggle, but the royal
    Honor is secure.
</pre>

      <p>Therefore</p>
      <pre>
Speak the truth, though harsh it be:
Blarney is true enmity.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
Where royal servants, asked or not,
    Indulge in pleasant lies
That lead the royal mind astray,
    The royal glory dies.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Furthermore, counselors should be consulted severally by
      the master, who should thereupon make his own decision
      concerning the advice given by each, as tending to the king’s
      loss or profit. For it happens at times that even an
      established fact seems otherwise to a wandering judgment. As
      the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
The firefly seems a fire, the sky looks flat;
Yet sky and fly are neither this nor that.
</pre>

      <p>And again:</p>
      <pre>
The true seem often false, the false seem true;
Appearances deceive, so think it through.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Consequently, a master should not implicitly rely on the
      advice of a servant who lacks the administrative sense,
      inasmuch as rascally servants, for their personal profit,
      present matters to the master in a false light, and with
      bewildering eloquence. Hence, a master should undertake a
      matter only after full reflection. As the proverb says:</p>
      <pre>
Let fit and friendly counsel first,
    And more than once, be heard;
Then ponder on the plan proposed
    From first to final word;
Then act, and harvest fame and wealth,
    Avoiding the absurd.
</pre>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>“Finally, let no master suffer his mind to be twitched
      aside by others’ counsel. Let him always be mindful of the
      differences in men, let him fully consider the ultimate
      issue, whether favorable or the reverse, of various counsels,
      answers, and times of action. Let him <em>be</em> the master,
      a wise master, ever cognizant of the multiform complexities
      of duty.”</p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p class="parbreak"><br /></p>

      <p>Here ends Book I, called “The Loss of Friends.” The first
      verse runs:</p>
      <pre>
The forest lion and the bull
Were linked in friendship, growing, full;
A jackal then estranged the friends
For greedy and malicious ends.
